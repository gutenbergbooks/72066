<p class="drop-cap">TUBAL gave the key another quarter turn in the
quoins and tested the security of the type in
the form with the heel of his grimy hand. After
which he shut his eyes very tight and ran his tongue
carefully over his upper teeth and clucked. Then, in
the voice of one who pronounces a new and wonderful
thought he spoke:</p>

<p>“Simmy,” he said, “I dunno. Mebby so—mebby
not. There’s p’ints in favor and p’ints against.”</p>

<p>“I,” said Simmy with the cocksureness of his
seventeen years, “am goin’ to git through. Don’t
ketch me workin’ for no woman.”</p>

<p>“She’s one of them college wimmin we’ve been
readin’ about.”</p>

<p>“Makes it wuss. Wimmin,” said Simmy, who
had given deep thought to such matters and reached
profound conclusions, “hain’t got no business gittin’
all eddicated up. What they ought to study is cook
books. That’s what <i>I</i> say.”</p>

<p>“Calc’late she’ll be gifted with big words.”</p>

<p>“She’ll wear them kind of glasses,” said Simmy,
“that’ll make you think you’re lookin’ into the show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
winders of the Busy Big Store if you come onto her
face to face.”</p>

<p>“Simmy, I’ll tell you suthin’.... I’ll be fifty
year old, come September, and I hain’t never married
one of ’em yit.”</p>

<p>“I hain’t never goin’ to marry, neither.”</p>

<p>“Shake,” said Tubal.</p>

<p>There ensued a silence while Tubal completed the
locking of the form and secured it on the job press.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tubal for the hundredth time, “Ol’
Man Nupley’s dead and gone.”</p>

<p>“Seems like he might ’a’ left this here paper to you
’n’ me that’s worked and slaved fer him, instid of to
this female nephew of his’n....”</p>

<p>“Niece,” corrected Tubal. “No.... Ol’ Man
Nupley wa’n’t fond of me, but he didn’t owe me no
grudge to warrant him wishin’ this thing onto me.
Say, we got out two issues since he passed away,
hain’t we? You ’n’ me—alone and unaided....
Gawd!” Tubal mopped his brow at recollection of
the mental anguish suffered in achieving this feat of
editorship.</p>

<p>“They was dum good issues,” Simmy said,
pridefully.</p>

<p>Tubal was not without his pride in the accomplishment—a
pride tinctured with doubt which had been
made acute that very morning when he stopped in
the post office for the mail. Certain of the village’s
professional humorists had greeted him with enthusiasm,
and quoted from his works with relish.
Tubal had been very much put to it for copy to fill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the paper, and had seized upon every incident, great
or small, as worthy of mention, and as lengthy mention
as he could achieve. He had not used one word
where there was a possibility of enlisting two. For
instance, after hearing it quoted, he felt there
was some defect in the style of the personal which
stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our fellow townsman, Herbert Whitcomb, has painted his
large and spacious and comfortable residence on Pine Street near
the corner with a coat of white paint. Herb did the job himself,
working evenings, but not Sundays, he being a Methodist
and superintendent of the Sunday School. Many assembled to
watch our Selectman and tyler of the Masonic lodge (Herb)
working at the job of painting his residence, and thus, besides
showing public spirit in improving the general appearance of
our village, gave many something to do, there being no other
amusement in town. Good for you, Herb. That is the spirit
we like.</p>
</div>

<p>He had rather fancied the item about Jim Bagby,
and considered he had filled the maximum space with
a minute piece of news.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jim Bagby our prominent farmer and Democrat from north
of town, has been dynamiting out the stumps out of the pasture
lot that he has used to pasture cattle. Jim used for the purpose
the best and most powerful brand of dynamite he could
get and the numerous explosions of the dynamite, each blast removing
a stump out of the pasture, could be heard the length
and breadth of the village. Dynamite, says Jim, is the thing
to make the wilderness blossom like a rose. Another year we
hope to see the pasture out of which Jim dynamited the stumps
covered with the verdure of potatoes or other garden truck.</p>
</div>

<p>Tubal recalled the mental anguish which went into
the composition of these and columns of other similar
items, and solemnly renounced forever the dignities
of editorship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“No,” he said, waggling his head gravely, “I
calc’late Ol’ Man Nupley done us a favor by leavin’
this sheet to somebody else.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be comin’ on the noon train,” said Simmy.
“That’s when I quit.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose,” Tubal said, as he cocked his eye at a
cockroach scurrying across the floor, “she’ll favor
Ol’ Man Nupley in looks. Seems like that’s a cross
heavier ’n any woman ought to bear.” He estimated
the rate of progress of the roach, and, as it were,
brought down his bird with a supremely skillfully
aimed deluge of the juice of the weed. “If wimmin
is goin’ to insist on keepin’ on bein’ wimmin, they
ought to see to it you kin look at ’em without
sufferin’.”</p>

<p>“Mebby she’s jest comin’ up to sell out,” said
Simmy, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Sell? Sell this here rag?... Say!”</p>

<p>“Why not, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Tubal, “it owes about two hundred
dollars more’n it’s wuth ... and, now we lost
the county advertisin’, it’ll owe a dum sight more.”</p>

<p>He walked to the door which gave from the front
of the shop to the business and editorial office of the
paper, and there he stood as if upon some vantage
point, surveying all that existed of the Gibeon <i>Free
Press</i>. What he saw was not especially inviting;
nowhere was an indication of that romance which is
believed to lurk about the business of disseminating
news. The shop wore the haphazard look of a junk
yard, contented to recline and snore in dust and frowziness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
The room wore the air of a place where
nothing ever happens and where nothing is apt to
happen.... Just inside the door squatted the antiquated,
limping cylinder press which gave birth
weekly to the <i>Free Press</i>, and which gave off with
sullen brazenness the look of overmuch child-bearing.
It knew it was going to break down in the middle
of every run, and it had been cursed at so often and
so fluently that it was utterly indifferent. It was a
press without ambition. Of late years it had gotten
into a frame of mind where it didn’t care a hang
whether it printed a paper or not—which is an alarming
state of mind for a printing press to be in....
Over to the right were shelves of stock, ill sorted,
dusty, dog eared at the corners where Tubal had
rubbed his shoulder against them in passing. Thin
stacks of red and blue board, upon which tickets for
the Methodist lawn sociable or the Baptist chicken
dinner might be painted, lopped with discouraged
limpness over the edge of the shelving and said improper
and insulting things to the slatternly press. A
couple of stones elbowed each other and a case of
type a little further back, and a comparatively new
(and unpaid-for) job press, whose paint still existed
even to shininess in spots, rather stuck up its nose
at the rest of the company and felt itself altogether
too good for such society. There was also a theoretical
spittoon—theoretical because it was the one
spot in the room safe from Tubal’s unerring jets of
tobacco juice. These were the high spots arising
from a jumble of rubbish which it was easier to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
kick about from place to place than to remove altogether....
Tubal waggled his head.</p>

<p>He turned to survey the business and editorial
office, and found nothing there to uplift his soul.
There was a grimy railing of matched lumber, inside
which a table staggered under an accumulation of exchanges
and catalogues and old cuts brought in to
pass the evening of their lives as paper weights. An
old black-walnut desk with a bookcase in its second
story tried to maintain a faded dignity beside an old
safe from which the combination knob had been removed
for fear somebody would shut and lock it, as
once happened, with disastrous results. On the wall
hung a group picture of the state legislature of 1882.
One could have bedded down a cow very comfortably
in the waste paper on the floor.</p>

<p>“Simmy,” said Jake, solemnly, “she’s a hell of a
messy place. Seems like we ought to kind of tidy
up some for the new proprietor—or suthin’. No use,
though. Hain’t no place to begin. Only thing wuth
cleanin’ up is the chattel mortgage Abner Fownes
holds over the place....” He turned and scowled
at Simmy and smote his hands together. “By Jing!”
he said, “the’s one thing we kin do—we kin wash
your face. That’ll <i>show</i>.”</p>

<p>Simmy responded by jerking his thumb toward
the front door, before which two men had paused,
one a diminutive hunchback, the other an enormous,
fleshy individual with a beard of the sort worn, not
for adornment, but as the result of indolence which
regards shaving as a labor not to be endured. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
pair talked with manifest excitement for a moment
before they entered.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” said Tubal.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” said the corpulent one. The hunchback
squinted and showed his long and very white teeth,
but did not respond verbally to the greeting.</p>

<p>“Say,” said the big man, “seen the sheriff?”</p>

<p>“Why?” replied Tubal.</p>

<p>“’Cause,” said Deputy Jenney, “if you hain’t nobody
has.”</p>

<p>“Since last night about nine o’clock,” said the
hunchback in the unpleasant, high-pitched voice not
uncommon to those cursed as he was cursed.</p>

<p>“He got off’n the front porch last night around
nine o’clock and says to his wife he was goin’ out
to pump him a pail of fresh water. Didn’t put on a
hat or nothin’.... That’s the last anybody’s seen
of him. Yes, sir. Jest stepped into the house and
out of the back door——”</p>

<p>“Mebby he fell down the well,” said Tubal, helpfully.</p>

<p>“His wife’s terrible upsot. I been searchin’ for
him since daybreak, but not a hide or hair kin I
find—nor a soul that seen him. He might of went
up in a balloon right out of his back yard for all the
trace he’s left.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mistrust?” asked Tubal.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> hain’t seen him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, say, don’t make no hullabaloo about it in
the paper—yit. Mebby everything’s all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>The hunchback laughed, not a long, hearty laugh
of many haw-haw-haws after the fashion of male
Gibeon, but one short nasal sound that was almost a
squawk.</p>

<p>“Might be,” said Simmy, “he sneaked off to lay
for one of them rum runners.”</p>

<p>“What rum runners?” said the hunchback, snapping
out the words viciously and fixing his gimlet
eyes on the boy with an unblinking stare.</p>

<p>“The ones,” said Simmy, with perfect logic,
“that’s doin’ the rum runnin’.”</p>

<p>“Hum!... Jest dropped in to ask if you seen
him—and to kind of warn you not to go printin’
nothin’ prematurelike. We’ll be gittin’ along, Peewee
and me.... Seems mighty funny a man ’u’d
up and disappear like that, especial the sheriff, without
leavin’ no word with <i>me</i>.” Deputy Jenney allowed
his bulk to surge toward the door, and Peewee
Bangs followed at his heels—a good-natured, dull-witted
mastiff and an off-breed, heel-snapping, terrier
mongrel....</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tubal, “that’s that. I hain’t mislaid
no pet sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Mebby,” said Simmy, with bated breath, “them
miscreants has waylaid him and masa<i>creed</i> him.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!... Say, you been readin’ them dime-novel,
Jesse James stories ag’in.... Go wash your
face.”</p>

<p>In the distance, echoing from hill to hill and
careening down the valley, sounded the whistle of a
locomotive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“On time,” said Tubal.</p>

<p>“And <i>her</i> comin’ on it,” said Simmy.</p>

<p>From that moment neither of them spoke. They
remained in a sort of state of suspended animation,
listening for the arrival of the train, awaiting the
arrival of the new proprietor of the Gibeon <i>Free
Press</i>.... Ten minutes later the bus stopped before
the door and a young woman alighted. Two
pairs of eyes inside the printing office stared at her
and then turned to meet.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t her,” said Tubal.</p>

<p>Tubal based his statement upon a preconception
with which the young lady did not at all agree. She
was small and very slender. Tubal guessed she was
eighteen, when, as a matter of fact, she was twenty-two.
There was about her an air of class, of breeding
such as Tubal had noted in certain summer visitors
in Gibeon. From head to feet she was dressed
in white—a tiny white hat upon her chestnut hair,
a white jacket, a white skirt, not too short, but of
suitable length for an active young woman, and
white buckskin shoes.... All these points Tubal
might have admitted in the new owner of the <i>Free
Press</i>, but when he scrutinized her face, he <i>knew</i>.
No relative of Old Man Nupley could look like
that! She was lovely—no less—with the dazzling,
bewitching loveliness of intelligent youth. She
was something more than lovely, she was individual.
There was a certain pertness about her nose
and chin, humor lurked in the corners of her eyes.
She would think and say interesting things, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
would be very difficult to frighten her.... Tubal
waggled his head, woman-hater that he was, and
admitted inwardly that there were points in her
favor.</p>

<p>And then—and then she advanced toward the door
and opened it.</p>

<p>“This is the office of the <i>Free Press</i>, is it not?”
she said.</p>

<p>“Yes ’m. What kin we do for you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure. A great deal, I hope.... I am
Carmel Lee—the—the new editor of this paper.”</p>

<p>In his astonishment Tubal pointed a lean, inky
finger at the tip of her nose, and poked it at her twice
before he could speak. “You!... <i>You!</i>” he said,
and then swallowed hard, and felt as if he were unpleasantly
suspended between heaven and earth with
nothing to do or say.</p>

<p>“I,” she answered.</p>

<p>Tubal swung his head slowly and glared at Simmy,
evidently laying the blame for this dénoûement upon
the boy’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Git out of here,” he whispered, hoarsely, “and
for Gawd’s sake—<i>wash your face</i>.”</p>

<p>Simmy vanished, and Tubal, praying for succor,
remained, nonplused, speechless for once.</p>

<p>“Is that my desk?” asked Miss Lee. “Um!...”
Then she won Tubal’s undying devotion at a single
stroke. “I presume,” she said, “you are foreman of
the composing room.”</p>

<p>He nodded dumbly.</p>

<p>“You—you look very nice and efficient. I’m glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
I’m going to have a man like you to help me....
Is it <i>very</i> hard to run a real newspaper?”</p>

<p>“It’s easy. You hain’t got any idea how easy it is.
Why, Simmy and me, we done it for two issues, and
’twan’t no chore to speak of!... Where’s that
Simmy?... Hey, Simmy!”</p>

<p>“He went,” said Miss Lee, “to wash his face....
Now I think I shall go to the hotel. It’s next door,
isn’t it?... After I have lunch I’ll come back, and
we’ll go to work. You’ll—have to take me in hand,
won’t you?... Is this a—a profitable paper?”</p>

<p>“By gosh! it will be. We’ll make her the doggonedest
paper ’n the state. We’ll——”</p>

<p>“Thank <i>you</i>,” said Miss Lee. “Right after lunch
we’ll start in.” And with that she walked daintily
out of the office and turned toward the Commercial
House.... Tubal gave a great sigh and leaned
on the office railing.</p>

<p>“<i>Has she gone?</i>” came a whisper from the shop.</p>

<p>“You come here. Git in here where I kin talk
to you.”</p>

<p>“Here I be.... Say, when do we quit?”</p>

<p>“Quit? Quit what?”</p>

<p>“Our jobs. We was goin’ to. You ’n’ me won’t
work for no woman?”</p>

<p>“Who said so? Who said anythin’ about quittin’,
I’d like to know. Not me.... And say, if I ketch
you tryin’ to quit, I’ll skin you alive.... You ’n’
me, we got to stick by that leetle gal, we have....
Foreman of the composin’ room!... By jing!...
Perty as a picture.... By jing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Say, you gone crazy, or what?”</p>

<p>“She’s a-comin’ back right after lunch. Git to
work, you. Git this office cleaned up and swept up
and dusted up.... Think she kin work amongst
this filth.... Git a mop and a pail. We’ll fix up
this hole so’s she kin eat off’n the floor if she takes
a notion.... Simmy, she’s goin’ to stay and run
this here paper. That cunnin’ leetle gal’s goin’ to be
our boss.... Goddlemighty!...”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CARMEL LEE had been told by everybody, ever
since she could remember being told anything,
that she was headstrong and impulsive. Her parents
had impressed it upon her and, rather proudly, had
disseminated the fact among the neighbors until it
became a tradition in the little Michigan town where
she was born. People held the idea that one must
make allowances for Carmel and be perpetually ready
to look with tolerance on outbursts of impulse. Her
teachers had accepted the tradition and were accustomed
to advise with her upon the point. The reputation
accompanied her to the university, and only
a few weeks before, upon her graduation, the head
of the Department of Rhetoric (which included a
course in journalism) spent an entire valuable hour
beseeching her to curb her willfulness and to count
as high as fifty before she reached a decision.</p>

<p>So Carmel, after being the victim of such propaganda
for sixteen or seventeen years, could not be
censured if she believed it herself. She had gotten
to be rather afraid of Carmel and of what Carmel
might do unexpectedly. Circumspection and repression
had become her watchwords, and the present
business of her life was to look before she leaped.
She had made a vow of deliberation. As soon as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
found herself wanting to do something she became
suspicious of it; and latterly, with grim determination,
she had taken herself in hand. Whenever she
became aware of a desire to act, she compelled herself
to sit down and think it over. Not that this did
a great deal of good, but it gave her a very pleasing
sensation of self-mastery. As a matter of fact, she
was not at all introspective. She had taken the word
of bystanders for her impulsiveness; it was no discovery
of her own. And now that she was schooling
herself in repression, she did not perceive in the
least that she failed to repress. When she wanted
to do a thing, she usually did it. The deliberation
only postponed the event. When she forced herself
to pause and scrutinize a desire, she merely paused
and scrutinized it—and then went ahead and did
what she desired.</p>

<p>It may be considered peculiar that a girl who had
inherited a newspaper, as Carmel had done, should
have paid so cursory a first visit. It would have been
natural to rush into the shop with enthusiasm and
to poke into corners and to ransack the place from
end to end, and to discover exactly what it was she
had become owner of. However, Carmel merely
dropped in and hurried away.... This was repression.
It was a distinct victory over impulse.
She wanted to do it very much, so she compelled
herself to turn her back and to go staidly to lunch
at the hotel.</p>

<p>She ate very little and was totally unaware of the
sensation she created in the dining room, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
over at the square table which was regarded as the
property of visiting commercial travelers. It was
her belief that she gave off an impression of dignity
such as befitted an editor, and that a stern, businesslike
air sat upon her so that none could mistake the
fact that she was a woman of affairs. Truthfulness
compels it to be recorded that she did not give this
impression at all, but quite another one. She looked
a lovely schoolgirl about to go canoeing with a box
of bonbons on her lap. The commercial travelers
who were so unfortunate as to be seated with their
back toward her acquired cricks in their necks.</p>

<p>After dinner (in a day or two she would learn
not to refer to it as luncheon) she compelled herself
to go up to her room and to remain there for a full
fifteen minutes. After this exercise, so beneficial to
her will, she descended and walked very slowly to
the office of the <i>Free Press</i>. Having thus given free
rein to her bent for repression, she became herself
and <i>pounced</i>. She pounced upon the office; she
pounced upon the shop. She made friends with the
cylinder press much as an ordinary individual would
make friends with a nice dog, and she talked to the
little job press as to a kitten and became greatly excited
over the great blade of the paper cutter, and
wanted Tubal to give her an instant lesson in the
art of sticking type. For two hours she played with
things. Then, of a sudden, it occurred to her to
wonder if a living could be made out of the outfit.</p>

<p>It was essential that the paper should provide her
with a living, and that it should go about the business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
of doing so almost instantly. At the moment when
Carmel first set foot in Gibeon she was alone in the
world. Old Man Nupley had been her last remaining
relative. And—what was even more productive
of unease of mind—she was the owner of exactly
seventy-two dollars and sixteen cents!</p>

<p>Therefore she pounced upon the records of the
concern and very quickly discovered that Old Man
Nupley had left her no placer mine out of which she
could wash a pan of gold before breakfast. She had,
she found, become the owner of the right to pay
off a number of pressing debts. The plant was
mortgaged. It owed for paper; there were installments
due on the job press; there were bills for this,
that, and the other thing which amounted to a
staggering total....</p>

<p>She was not daunted, however, until she examined
the credit side of the affair. The year had brought
the <i>Free Press</i> a grand total of five hundred and
sixty-one paid subscriptions; the advertising, at the
absurd rate of fifteen cents an inch, had been what
politicians call scattering; and the job work had
hardly paid for the trouble of keeping the dust off
the press. The paper was dead on its feet, as so
many rural weeklies are. She could not help thinking
that her uncle Nupley had died in the nick of
time to avoid bankruptcy.</p>

<p>It is worth recording that Carmel did not weep a
tear of disappointment, nor feel an impulse to walk
out of the place and go the thousand miles back to
Michigan to take the job of teaching English in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
home high school. No. The only emotion Carmel
felt was anger. Her eyes actually glinted, and a
red spot made its appearance upon each cheek. She
had arrived in Gibeon with a glowing illusion packed
in her trunk; unkind fact had snatched it away and
replaced it with clammy reality.</p>

<p>She got up from her desk and walked into the shop,
where Tubal was pretending to be busy.</p>

<p>“Gibeon is the county seat, isn’t it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes ’m.”</p>

<p>“How many people live here?”</p>

<p>“We claim two thousand. Ol’ Man Nupley allowed
the’ was four thousand in the township.”</p>

<p>“Then” (her manner put Tubal in the wrong at
once and compelled him to fumble about for a defense)
“why have we only a little more than five
hundred subscribers?”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, one thing or another, seems as though.
Folks never took to this paper much.... Mostly
they take in the <i>Standard</i> from over to Litchfield.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Tubal shifted the blame to Gibeon. “Seems like
this hain’t much of a town.... It’s a dum funny
town. I guess folks didn’t set much store by this
paper on account of Abner Fownes.”</p>

<p>“Abner Fownes? Who is he, and what has he
to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Abner,” said Tubal, “comes clost to bein’ a one-man
band. Uh huh!... Owns the saw mills, owns
half of Main Street, owns the Congo church and the
circuit judge and the selectmen, and kind of claims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
to own all the folks that lives here.... Ol’ Man
Nupley was a kind of errand boy of his’n.”</p>

<p>Carmel’s intuition carried her to the point. “And
the people didn’t take this paper because they didn’t
trust it. That was it, wasn’t it—because this Abner
Fownes—owned Uncle Nupley.”</p>

<p>“I calc’late,” said Tubal, “you’re twittin’ on facts....”
He chuckled. “Las’ fall the folks kind of riz
ag’in’ Abner and dum nigh trompled on him at
election time. Yes, sir. Made a fight fer it, but
they didn’t elect nobody but one sheriff. Good man,
too.... But Abner was too slick for ’em and he
run off with all the other offices.... He holds a
chattel mortgage onto this plant.”</p>

<p>“Is he a bad man?”</p>

<p>“Wa-al I dunno’s a feller could call him bad.
Jest pig-headed, like, and got the idee nobody knows
nothin’ but him. <i>My</i> notion is he gits bamboozled
a lot. The Court House crowd tickles his ribs and
makes him work for ’em. No, he hain’t bad.
Deacon, and all that.”</p>

<p>“The local politicians flatter him and make use of
the power his money gives him, is that it?”</p>

<p>“You hit the nail plumb on the head.”</p>

<p>“Who is the <i>real</i> boss?”</p>

<p>“Wa-al now, that’s kind of hard to say. Kind of
a ring. Half a dozen of ’em. Calc’late Supervisor
Delorme is close to bein’ the queen bee.”</p>

<p>She could visualize Abner Fownes, smug, fatuous,
in a place of power which he did not know how to
use, a figurehead and cat’s-paw for abler and wickeder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
men.... It must be confessed that her interest in
him was not civic, but personal. He was, at that
moment, of no importance to her except as the man
who held a chattel mortgage on her plant and whose
influence over her uncle had withered the possible
prosperity of the paper.</p>

<p>She was saying to herself: “I’ve got to find a way.
I’ve got to make a success of this. I can’t go back
home and admit I couldn’t do it.... Everybody
said I couldn’t run a paper. But I can. I <i>can</i>.”</p>

<p>The field was there, a prosperous town with a
cultivated countryside to the south and rich forest
lands to north and west. There was a sufficient
population to support well a weekly paper; there was
all of Main Street, two dozen merchants large and
small, whose advertising patronage should flow in
to the <i>Free Press</i>.</p>

<p>“What it needs,” she told herself, “is somebody
to get behind and push.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact she was convinced the failure
of the paper was not due to Abner Fownes, nor to
politics or outside influences, but to the lack of
initiative and ability of her uncle. So much of the
town as she had seen was rather pleasing; it had no
appearance of resting over subterranean caverns of
evil, nor had the men and women she saw on the
streets the appearance of being ground down by one
man’s wealth, or of smarting under the rule of an
evil political ring. On the contrary, it seemed an
ordinary town, full of ordinary people, who lived
ordinary lives in reasonable happiness. She discounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Tubal’s disclosures and jumped to a conclusion.
No, she told herself, if she proved adequate,
there was no reason why she could not succeed where
Uncle Nupley failed.</p>

<p>The telephone interrupted her reflections and she
lifted the receiver.</p>

<p>“Is this the <i>Free Press</i>?” asked a voice.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, please.”</p>

<p>After some delay another voice, a large, important
voice, repeated the question, and Carmel admitted
a second time the identity of the paper.</p>

<p>“This,” said the voice, evidently impressed by the
revelation it was making, “is Abner Fownes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Are you the young woman—Nupley’s niece?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Will you step over to my office at once, then. I
want to see you?”</p>

<p>Carmel’s eyes twinkled and her brows lifted.
“Abner Fownes,” she said. “The name has a masculine
sound. Your voice is—distinctly masculine?”</p>

<p>“Eh?... What of it?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Carmel, “the little book I studied in
school says that when a gentleman wishes to see a
lady he goes to her. I fear I should be thought
forward if I called on you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all.... Not at all,” said the voice, and
Carmel knew she had to deal with a man in whom
resided no laughter.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to see you whenever you find it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
convenient to call,” she said—and hung up the
receiver.</p>

<p>As she turned about she saw a young man standing
outside the railing, a medium-sized young man
who wore his shoulders slightly rounded and spectacles
of the largest and most glittering variety. The
collar of his coat asked loudly to be brushed and his
tie had the appearance of having been tied with one
hand in a dark bedroom. He removed his hat and
displayed a head of extraordinarily fine formation.
It was difficult to tell if he were handsome, because
the rims of his spectacles masked so much of his
face and because his expression was one of gloomy
wrath. Carmel was tempted to laugh at the expression
because it did not fit; it gave the impression of
being a left-over expression, purchased at a reduction,
and a trifle large for its wearer.</p>

<p>“May I ask,” he said, in a voice exactly suited
to his stilted diction, “if you are in charge of this—er—publication?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“I wish,” said the young man, “to address a communication
to the citizens of this village through the—er—medium
of your columns.”</p>

<p>So this, thought Carmel, was the sort of person
who wrote letters to newspapers. She had often
wondered what the species looked like.</p>

<p>“On what subject?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Myself,” said he.</p>

<p>“It should be an interesting letter,” Carmel said,
mischievously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>The young man lowered his head a trifle and peered
at her over the rims of his glasses. He pursed his
mouth and wrinkled one cheek, studying her as a
naturalist might scrutinize some interesting, but not
altogether comprehensible, bug. Evidently he could
not make up his mind as to her classification.</p>

<p>“I fancy it will be found so,” he said.</p>

<p>“May I ask your name?”</p>

<p>He fumbled in an inner pocket and continued to
fumble until it became an exploration. He produced
numerous articles and laid them methodically upon
the railing—a fountain pen, dripping slightly, half
a dozen letters, a large harmonica, a pocket edition of
Plato’s <i>Republic</i>, a notebook, several pencils, and a
single glove. He stared at the glove with recognition
and nodded to it meaningly, as much as to say:
“Ah, there you are again.... Hiding as usual.”
At last he extracted a leather wallet and from the
wallet produced a card which he extended toward
Carmel.</p>

<p>Before she read it she had a feeling there would
be numerous letters upon it, and she was not disappointed.
It said:</p>

<p>Evan Bartholomew Pell, A.B., Ph.D., LL.D.,
A.M.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the young man with some complacency.</p>

<p>“And your letter.”</p>

<p>“I am,” he said, “or, more correctly, I <i>was</i>,
superintendent of schools in this village. There
are, as you know, three schools only one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
which gives instruction in the so-called high-school
branches.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“I have been removed,” he said, and stared at her
with lips compressed. When she failed to live up
to his expectations in her manifestations of consternation,
he repeated his statement. “I have been
removed,” he said, more emphatically.</p>

<p>“Removed,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Removed. Unjustly and unwarrantably removed.
Autocratically and tyrannically removed. I am a
victim of nepotism. I have, I fancy, proven adequate;
indeed, I may say it is rare to find a man of
my attainments in so insignificant a position....
But I have been cast out upon the streets arbitrarily,
that a corrupt and self-seeking group of professional
politicians may curry favor with a man more corrupt
than themselves. In short and in colloquial terms, I
have been kicked out to provide a place for Supervisor
Delorme’s cousin.”</p>

<p>Carmel nodded. “And you wish to protest.”</p>

<p>“I desire to lay before the public my ideas of the
obligation of the public toward its children in the
matter of education. I desire to protest against
glaring injustice. I desire to accuse a group of men
willing to prostitute the schools to the level of political
spoils. I wish to protest at being set adrift
penniless.”</p>

<p>His expression as he uttered the word “penniless”
was one of helpless bewilderment which touched
Carmel’s sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Penniless?” she said.</p>

<p>“I am no spendthrift,” he said, severely. “I may
say that I am exceedingly economical. But I have
invested my savings, and—er—returns have failed
to materialize from the investment.”</p>

<p>“What investment?”</p>

<p>The young man eyed her a moment as if he felt
her to be intruding unwarrantably in his private concerns,
but presently determined to reply.</p>

<p>“A certain gold mine, whose location I cannot remember
at the moment. It was described as of
fabulous wealth, and I was assured the return from
my investment of five hundred dollars would lift me
above the sordid necessity of working for wages....
I regret to say that hitherto there has been no
material assurance of the truth of the statements
made to me.”</p>

<p>“Poor lamb!” said Carmel under her breath.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>Carmel shook her head. “So you are—out of a
job—and broke?” she said.</p>

<p>“Broke,” he said, lugubriously, “is an exceedingly
expressive term.”</p>

<p>“And what shall you do?”</p>

<p>He looked about him, at his feet, through the
door into the shop, under the desk, at the picture on
the wall in a helpless, bewildered way as if he thought
his future course of action might be hiding some
place in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” he said.</p>

<p>Carmel considered. Inexperienced as she was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
new to the intrigues of Gibeon, she was able to perceive
how the professor’s letter was loaded with
dynamite—not for him, but for the paper which
published it. Notwithstanding, it was her impulse
to print it. Indeed, her mind was firmly made up
to print it. Therefore she assumed an attitude of
deliberation, as she had schooled herself to do.</p>

<p>“If you give me the letter,” she said, “I will read
it and consider the wisdom of making it public.”</p>

<p>“I shall be obliged to you,” he said, and turned
toward the door. Midway he paused. “If,” he
said, “you chance to hear of a position—as teacher
or otherwise—to which I may be adapted, I shall
be glad to have you communicate with me.”</p>

<p>He moved again toward the door, opened it, paused
again, and turned full to face Carmel. Then he
made a statement sharply detached from the context,
and astonishing not so much for the fact it stated as
because of the man who stated it, his possible reasons
for making the statement, and the abruptness of the
change of subject matter.</p>

<p>“Sheriff Churchill has disappeared,” he said. Having
made the statement, he shut the door after him
and walked rapidly up the street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARMEL more than half expected Abner Fownes
to appear in the office, but he did not appear.
Indeed, it was some days before she caught so much
as a casual glimpse of him on the street. But she
was gathering information about him and about
the town of Gibeon and the county of which it was
the center. Being young, with enthusiasm and ideals,
and a belief in the general virtue of the human race,
she was not pleased.</p>

<p>She set about it to study Gibeon as she would
have studied some new language, commencing with
elementals, learning a few nouns and verbs and the
local rules of the grammar of life. She felt she
must know Gibeon as she knew the palm of her
hand, if she were to coax the <i>Free Press</i> out of the
slough into which it had slipped.</p>

<p>But it was not easy to know Gibeon, for Gibeon
did not know itself. Like so many of our American
villages, it was not introspective—even at election
time. The tariff and the wool schedule and Wall
Street received from it more attention than did keeping
its own doorstep clean. It was used to its
condition, and viewed it as normal. There were
moments of excited interest and hot-blooded talk.
Always there was an undercurrent of rumor; but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
seemed to Carmel the town felt a certain pride in
the iniquity of its politics. A frightful inertia resides
in the mass of mankind, and because of this
inertia tsars and princes and nobilities and Tammany
Societies and bosses and lobbies and pork barrels
and the supreme tyranny of war have existed since
men first invented organization.... Sometimes it
seems the world’s supply of energy is cornered by the
ill-disposed. Rotten governments and administrations
are tolerated by the people because they save the
people the trouble of establishing and conducting
something better.</p>

<p>In a few days Carmel perceived a great deal that
was going on in Gibeon, and understood a little of
it, and, seeing and understanding as she did, an
ambition was born in her, the ambition to wake up
Gibeon. This ambition she expressed to Tubal, who
listened and waggled his head.</p>

<p>“One time,” he said, “I worked fer a reform newspaper—till
it went into bankruptcy.”</p>

<p>“But look—”</p>

<p>“I been lookin’ a sight longer ’n’ you have, Lady.”
At first he had called her Lady as a dignified and
polite form of greeting. After that it became
a sort of title of affection, which spread from
Tubal to Gibeon. “I been lookin’ and seein’,
and what I see is that they’s jest one thing
folks is real int’rested in, and that’s earnin’ a
livin’.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it, Tubal. I believe people want
to do right. I believe everybody would rather do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
right and be good—if some one would just show
them how.”</p>

<p>“Mebby, but you better let somebody else take the
pointer and go to the blackboard. You got to eat
three times a day, Lady, and this here paper’s got
to step up and feed you. Look at it reasonable.
What d’ye <i>git</i> by stirrin’ things up? Why, half a
dozen real good folks claps their hands, but they
don’t give up a cent. What d’ye git if you keep
your hands off and let things slide? You git the
county printin’, and consid’able advertisin’ and job
work that Abner Fownes kin throw to you. You
git allowed to eat. And there you be.... Take
that letter of the perfessor’s, fer instance——”</p>

<p>“I’m going to print that letter if—if I starve.”</p>

<p>“Which is what the perfessor’s doin’ right now.... And
where’s Sheriff Churchill? Eh? Tell
me that.”</p>

<p>“Tubal, what is this about the sheriff? Has he
really disappeared?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t b’lieve it, go ask his wife. The
Court House crowd lets on he’s run off with a
woman or mebby stole some county funds. They
would.... But what woman? The’ wa’n’t no
woman. And Churchill wa’n’t the stealin’ kind.”</p>

<p>“What do you think, Tubal?”</p>

<p>“Lady, I don’t even dast to think.”</p>

<p>“What will be done?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’.”</p>

<p>“You mean the sheriff of a county can disappear—and
nothing be done about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“He kin in Gibeon. Oh, you keep your eye peeled.
Delorme and Fownes’ll smooth it over somehow,
and the folks kind of likes it. Gives ’em suthin’ to
talk about. Sure. When the’ hain’t no other topic
they’ll fetch up the sheriff and argue about what
become of him. But nobody’ll ever know—for
sure.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to see Mrs. Churchill,” said Carmel,
with sudden determination. “It’s news. It’s the
biggest news we’ll have for a long time.”</p>

<p>“H’m!... I dunno. Deputy Jenney and Peewee
Bangs they dropped in here a few days back
and give me a tip to lay off the sheriff. Anyhow,
everybody knows he’s gone.”</p>

<p>Carmel made no reply. She reached for her hat,
put it on at the desirable angle, and went out of the
door. Tubal stared after her a moment, fired an
accurate salvo at a nail head in the floor, and walked
back into the shop with the air of a man proceeding
to face a firing squad.</p>

<p>Carmel walked rapidly up Main Street past the
Busy Big Store and Smith Brothers’ grocery and
Miss Gammidge’s millinery shop, rounding the corner
on which was Field &amp; Hopper’s bank. She cut
diagonally across the Square, past the town pump,
and proceeded to the little house next the Rink. The
Rink had been erected some twenty-five years before
during the roller-skating epidemic, but was now
utilized as a manufactory of stepladders and plant
stands and kitchen chairs combined in one article.
This handy device was the invention of Pazzy Hendee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
whose avocation was inventing, but whose occupation
was constructing models of full-rigged
ships. It was in the little house, square, with a mansard
roof, that Sheriff Churchill’s family resided.
Carmel rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Come in,” called a woman’s voice.</p>

<p>Carmel hesitated, not knowing this was Gibeon’s
hospitable custom—that one had but to rap on a
door to be invited to enter.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the voice after a pause, and
Carmel obeyed.</p>

<p>“Right in the parlor,” the voice directed.</p>

<p>Carmel turned through the folding doors to the
right, and there, on the haircloth sofa, sat a stout,
motherly woman in state. She wore her black silk
with the air common to Gibeon when it wears its
black silk. It was evident Mrs. Churchill had laid
aside her household concerns in deference to the
event, and, according to precedent, awaited the visits
of condolence and curiosity of which it was the duty,
as well as the pleasure, of her neighbors to pay.</p>

<p>“Find a chair and set,” said Mrs. Churchill, scrutinizing
Carmel. “You’re the young woman that Nupley
left the paper to, hain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Carmel, “and I’ve come to ask about
your husband—if the subject isn’t too painful.”</p>

<p>“Painful! Laws! ’Twouldn’t matter how painful
’twas. Folks is entitled to know, hain’t they?
Him bein’ a public character. Was you thinkin’ of
havin’ a piece in the paper?”</p>

<p>“If you will permit,” said Carmel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>In spite of the attitude of state, in spite of something
very like pride in being a center of interest
and a dispenser of news, Carmel liked Mrs. Churchill.
Her face was the face of a woman who had
been a faithful helpmeet to her husband; of a woman
who would be summoned by neighbors in illness or
distress. Motherliness, greatness of heart, were
written on those large features; and a fine kindliness,
clouded by present sorrow, shone in her wise
eyes. Carmel had encountered women of like mold.
No village in America but is the better, more livable,
for the presence and ready helpfulness of this splendid
sisterhood.</p>

<p>“Please tell me about it,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“It was like this,” said Mrs. Churchill, taking on
the air of a narrator of important events. “The
sheriff and me was sittin’ on the porch, talkin’ as
pleasant as could be and nothin’ to give a body
warnin’. We was kind of arguin’ like about my
oldest’s shoes and the way he runs through a pair in
less’n a month. The sheriff he was holdin’ it was
right and proper boys should wear out shoes, and
I was sayin’ it was a sin and a shame sich poor
leather was got off on the public. Well, just there
the sheriff he got up and says he was goin’ to pump
himself a cold drink, and he went into the house,
and I could hear the pump squeakin’, but no thought
of anythin’. He didn’t come back, and he didn’t come
back, so I got up, thinkin’ to myself, what in tunket’s
he up to now and kind of wonderin’ if mebby he’d
fell in a fit or suthin’.” Carmel took note that Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Churchill talked without the air of punctuation
marks. “I went out to the back door and looked,
and the’ wa’n’t hide or hair of him in sight. I
hollered, but he didn’t answer....” Mrs. Churchill
closed her eyes and two great tears oozed between
the tightly shut lids and poised on the uplands of
her chubby cheeks. “And that’s all I know,” she
said in a dull voice. “He hain’t never come back.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea <i>why</i> he disappeared?”</p>

<p>“I got my idees. My husband was a man sot in
his ways—not but what I could manage him when
he needed managin’, and a better or more generous
provider never drew the breath of life. But he
calc’lated to do his duty. I guess he done it too
well!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mrs. Churchill?”</p>

<p>“The sheriff was an honest man. When the folks
elected him they chose him because he was honest
and nobody couldn’t move him out of a path he set
his foot to travel. He was close mouthed, too, but
I seen for weeks past he had suthin’ on his mind that
he wouldn’t come out with. He says to me once,
‘If folks knew what they was livin’ right next door
to!’ He didn’t say no more, but that was a lot for
him....” Suddenly her eyes glinted and her lips
compressed. “My husband was done away with,”
she said, “because he was a good man and a smart
man, and I’m prayin’ to God to send down vengeance
on them that done it.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment and her face took on the
grimness of righteous anger. “It’s reported to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
they’re settin’ afoot rumors that he run off with some
baggage—him that couldn’t bear me out of sight
these dozen year; him that couldn’t git up in the
mornin’ nor go to bed at night without me there to
help him! They lie! I know my man and I trust
him. He didn’t need no woman but me, and I didn’t
need no man but him.... Some says he stole county
money. They lie, too, and best for them they don’t
make no sich sayin’s in my hearin’....”</p>

<p>“What do you think is at bottom of it all?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill shook her head. “Some day it’ll
all come out,” she said, and her word was an assertion
of her faith in the goodness of God. There was
a pause, and then woman’s heart cried out to woman’s
heart for sympathy.</p>

<p>“I try to bear up and to endure it like he’d want
me to. But it’s lonely, awful lonely.... Lookin’
ahead at the years to come—without him by me....
Come nighttime and it seems like I can’t bear it.”</p>

<p>“But—but he’ll come back,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“<i>Back!</i> Child, there hain’t no <i>back</i> from where
my husband’s gone.”</p>

<p>Somehow this seemed to Carmel a statement of
authority. It established the fact. Sheriff Churchill
would never return, and his wife knew it. Something
had informed her past doubting. It gave Carmel
a strange, uncanny sensation, and she sat silent,
chilled. Then an emotion moved in her, swelled, and
lifted itself into her throat. It was something more
than mere anger, it was righteous wrath.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Churchill,” she said, “if this is true—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> 
thing you believe—then there are men in Gibeon
who are not fit to walk the earth. There is a
thing here which must be crushed—unearthed and
crushed.”</p>

<p>“If it is God’s will.”</p>

<p>“It must be God’s will. And if I can help—if I
can do one single small thing to help——”</p>

<p>“Mebby,” said Mrs. Churchill, solemnly, “He has
marked you out and set you apart as His instrument.”</p>

<p>“I want to think. I want to consider.” Carmel
got to her feet. “I—— Oh, this is a wicked, cruel,
cruel thing!...”</p>

<p>She omitted, in her emotion, any word of parting,
and walked from the house, eyes shining, lips compressed
grimly. In her ears a phrase repeated itself
again and again—“Mebby He has set you apart
as His instrument....”</p>

<p>On the Square she met Prof. Evan Bartholomew
Pell, who first peered at her through his great beetle
glasses and then confronted her.</p>

<p>“May I ask,” he said, brusquely, “what decision
you have reached concerning my letter?”</p>

<p>“I am going to print it,” she said.</p>

<p>He was about to pass on without amenities of any
sort whatsoever, but she arrested him.</p>

<p>“What are <i>your</i> plans?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I have none,” he said, tartly.</p>

<p>“No plans and no money?”</p>

<p>“That is a matter,” he said, “which it does not
seem to me is of interest to anyone but myself.”</p>

<p>She smiled, perceiving now he spoke out of a boyish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
shame and pride, and perceiving also in his eyes
an expression of worry and bewilderment which
demanded her sympathy.</p>

<p>“No schools are open at this time of year,” she
said.</p>

<p>“None. I do not think I shall teach again.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like school trustees,” he said, simply, and
one understood how he regarded the genus school
trustee as a separate classification of humanity, having
few qualities in common with the general human
race. “I—I shall <i>work</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>“At what? What, besides teaching, are you fitted
to do?”</p>

<p>“I—I can dig,” he said, looking at her hopefully.
“Anybody can dig. Men who dig eat—and have a
place to sleep. What more is there?”</p>

<p>“A great deal more.... Have you no place to
eat or sleep?” she said, suddenly.</p>

<p>“My landlady has set my trunk on the porch, and
as for food, I breakfasted on berries.... They are
not filling,” he added.</p>

<p>Carmel considered. In her few short days of
ownership she had discovered the magnitude of the
task of rehabilitating the <i>Free Press</i>. She had seen
how she must be business manager, advertising solicitor,
and editor, and that any of the three positions
could well demand all of her time. It would be
useless to edit a paper, she comprehended, if there
was no business to support it. Contrariwise, it
would be impossible to get business for a paper as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
futile as the <i>Free Press</i> was at that moment in its
history.</p>

<p>“How,” she said, “would you like to be an editor—a
kind of an editor?”</p>

<p>“I’d like it,” he said. “Then I could say to the
public the things I’d like to say to the public. You
can’t educate them. They don’t care. They are
sunk in a slough of inertia with a rock of ignorance
around their necks. I would like to tell them how
thick-headed they are. It would be a satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said Carmel, “you wouldn’t do for
an editor.”</p>

<p>“Why not, I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Carmel, “you don’t know very
much.”</p>

<p>She could see him swell with offended dignity.
“Good morning,” he said, and turned away without
lifting his hat.</p>

<p>“And you have very bad manners,” she added.</p>

<p>“Eh?... What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And I imagine you are awfully selfish and
self-centered. You don’t think about anybody but
yourself, do you? You—you imagine the universe
has its center in Prof. Evan Bartholomew Pell, and
you look down on everybody who hasn’t a lot of
degrees to string after his name. You don’t like
people.” She paused and snapped a question at
him. “How much did they pay you for being
superintendent of schools?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred dollars a year,” he said, the answer
being surprised out of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Doesn’t that take down your conceit?”</p>

<p>“Conceit!... Conceit!...”</p>

<p>“Yes—a good carpenter earns more than that.
The world can’t set such a high value on you if it
pays a mechanic more than it does you.”</p>

<p>“I told you,” he said, impatiently, “that the world
is silly and ignorant.”</p>

<p>“It is you who are silly and ignorant.”</p>

<p>“You—you have no right to talk to me like this.
You—you are forward and—and impertinent. I
never met such a young woman.”</p>

<p>“It’s for the good of your soul,” she said, “and
because—because I think I’m going to hire you to
write editorials and help gather news. Before you
start in, you’ve got to revise your notions of the
world—and of yourself. If you don’t like people,
people won’t like you.”</p>

<p>Evidently he had been giving scant attention to her
and plenary consideration to himself. “How much
will you pay me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“There you are!... I don’t know. Whatever
I pay you will be more than you are worth.”</p>

<p>He was thinking about himself again, and thinking
aloud.</p>

<p>“I fancy I should like to be an editor,” he said.
“The profession is not without dignity and scholarly
qualities——”</p>

<p>“Scholarly fiddlesticks!”</p>

<p>Again he paid her no compliment of attention.
“Why shouldn’t one be selfish? What does it
matter? What does anything matter? Here we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
in this world, rabbits caught in a trap. We can’t
escape. We’re here, and the only way to get out
of the trap is to die. We’re here with the trap
fastened to our foot, waiting to be killed. That’s
all. So what does anything matter except to get
through it somehow. Nobody can <i>do</i> anything. The
greatest man who ever lived hasn’t done a thing but
live and die. Selfish? Of course I’m selfish. Nothing
interests me but me. I want to stay in the trap
with as little pain and trouble as I can manage....
Everything and everybody is futile.... Now you
can let me be an editor or you can go along about
your business and leave me alone.”</p>

<p>“You have a sweet philosophy,” she said, cuttingly.
“If that is all your education has given you, the most
ignorant scavenger on the city streets is wiser and
better and more valuable to the world than you. I’m
ashamed of you.”</p>

<p>“Scavenger!...” His eyes snapped behind his
beetle glasses and he frowned upon her terribly.
“Now I’m going to be an editor—the silly kind of
an editor silly people like. Just to show you I can
do it better than they can. I’ll write better pieces
about Farmer Tubbs painting his barn red, and better
editorials about the potato crop. I’m a better man
than any of them, with a better brain and a better
education—and I’ll use my superiority to be a better
ass than any of them.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” she said, “you’ll never amount to
a row of pins until you really find a desire to be of
use to the world? If you try to help the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
sincerely and honestly, the world finds it out and helps
you—and loves you.... Don’t you want people to
like you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, when you can come to me and tell me you
do want people to like you, I’ll have some hopes of
you.... Report at the office at one o’clock. You’re
hired.”</p>

<p>She walked away from him rapidly, and he stood
peering after her with a lost, bewildered air. “What
an extraordinary young woman!” he said to himself.
Carmel seated herself at her desk to think. Her eyes
glanced downward at the fresh blotter she had put
in place the day before, and there they paused, for
upon its surface lay a grimy piece of paper upon
which was printed with a lead pencil:</p>

<p class="center">Don’t meddle with Sheriff Churchill or he’ll have company.</p>

<p>That was all, no signature, nothing but the message
and the threat. Carmel bit her lip.</p>

<p>“Tubal,” she called.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lady.”</p>

<p>“Who has been in the office—inside the railing?”</p>

<p>“Hain’t been a soul in this mornin’,” he said—“not
that I seen.”</p>

<p>Carmel crumpled the paper and threw it in the
waste basket. Then she picked up her pen and began
to write—the story of the disappearance of Sheriff
Churchill. Without doubt she broke the newspaper
rule that editorial matter should not be contained in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
a news story, but her anger and determination are
offered as some excuse for this. She ended the story
with a paragraph which said:</p>

<p>“The editor has been warned that she will be sent
to join Sheriff Churchill if she meddles with his
disappearance. The <i>Free Press</i> desires to give
notice now that it will meddle until the whole truth
is discovered and the criminals brought to justice.
If murder has been done, the murderers must be
punished.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Carmel entered the office next morning
she found Prof. Evan Bartholomew Pell occupying
her chair. On his face was an expression of
displeasure. He forgot to arise as she stepped through
the gate, but he did point a lead pencil at her
accusingly.</p>

<p>“You have made me appear ridiculous,” he said,
and compressed his lips with pedagogical severity.
“In my letter, which you published in this paper, you
misspelled the words ‘nefarious’ and ‘nepotist.’
What excuse have you to offer?”</p>

<p>Carmel stared at the young man, nonplused for an
instant, and then a wave of pity spread over her.
It was pity for a man who would not admit the
existence of a forest because he was able to see only
the individual trees. She wondered what life offered
to Evan Pell; what rewards it held out to him; what
promises it made. He was vain, that was clear; he
was not so much selfish as egotistical, and that must
have been very painful. He was, she fancied, the
sort of man to whom correct spelling was of greater
importance than correct principle—not because of any
tendency toward lack of principle, but because pedantry
formed a shell about him, inside which he lived
the life of a turtle. She smiled as she pictured him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
as a spectacled turtle of the snapping variety, and it
was a long time before that mental caricature was
erased from her mind. Of one thing she was certain;
it would not do to coddle him. Therefore she
replied, coolly: “Perhaps, if you would use ordinary
words which ordinary people can understand, you
would run less risk of misspelling—and people would
know what you are trying to talk about.”</p>

<p>“I used the words which exactly expressed my
meaning.”</p>

<p>“You are sitting in my chair,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>Evan Bartholomew flushed and bit his lips. “I—my
mind was occupied——” he said.</p>

<p>“With yourself,” said Carmel. “Have you come
to work?”</p>

<p>“That was my intention.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Please clear off that table and find a
chair.... You may smoke!”</p>

<p>“I do not use tobacco.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and again he flushed
as if he had been detected in something mildly shameful.
“I am wondering,” she said, “how you can be
of use.”</p>

<p>“I can at least see to it that simple words are
correctly spelled in this paper,” he said.</p>

<p>“So can Tubal, given time and a dictionary....
What have you done all your life? What experience
have you had?”</p>

<p>He cleared his throat. “I entered the university at
the age of sixteen,” he said, “by special dispensation.”</p>

<p>“An infant prodigy,” she interrupted. “I’ve often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
read about these boys who enter college when they
should be playing marbles, and I’ve always wondered
what became of them.”</p>

<p>“I have always been informed,” he said, severely,
“that I was an exceptionally brilliant child....
Since I entered college and until I came here a year
ago I have been endeavoring to educate myself
adequately. Before I was twenty I received both
LL.B. and A.B. Subsequently I took my master’s
degree. I have also worked for my D.C.L., my
Ph.D....”</p>

<p>She interrupted again. “With what end in view?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“End?...” He frowned at her through his spectacles.
“You mean what was my purpose?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Were you fitting yourself for any particular
work?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Merely piling up knowledge for the sake of piling
up knowledge.”</p>

<p>“You speak,” he said, “as if you were reprehensible.”</p>

<p>She made no direct reply, but asked his age.</p>

<p>“Twenty-six,” he said.</p>

<p>“Nine years of which you have spent in doing
nothing but study; cramming yourself with learning....
What in the world were you going to do
with all of it?”</p>

<p>“That,” he said, “is a matter I have had little time
to consider.”</p>

<p>“Did you make any friends in college?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“I had no time——”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Sanscrit is more important than
friends. I understand. A friend might have dropped
in of an evening and interrupted your studies.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course you did not go in for athletics.”</p>

<p>“Exercise,” he said, “scientifically taken, is essential
to a clear mind. I exercise regularly morning
and evening. If you are asking whether I allowed
myself to be pummeled and trampled into the mud
at football, or if I played any other futile game, I
did not.”</p>

<p>“So you know almost everything there is to be
known about books, but nothing about human
beings.”</p>

<p>“I fancy I know a great deal about human beings.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pell,” she said, becoming more determined
to crush in the walls of his ego, “I’ve a mind to tell
you exactly what I think of you.”</p>

<p>For an instant his eyes twinkled; Carmel was almost
sure of the twinkle and it quite nonplused her.
But Evan’s expression remained grave, aloof, a trifle
patronizing. “I understood I was coming here to—work.”</p>

<p>“You are.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said he, “suppose we give over this discussion
of myself and commence working.”</p>

<p>How Carmel might have responded to this impact
must remain a matter for debate, because she had not
quite rallied to the attack when the arrival of a
third person made continuance impossible. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
are people who just come; others who arrive. The
first class make no event of it whatever; there is a
moment when they are not present and an adjoining
moment when they are—and that is all there is to
it. The newcomer was an <i>arrival</i>. His manner was
that of an arrival and resembled somewhat the docking
of an ocean liner. Carmel could imagine little
tugs snorting and coughing and churning about him
as he warped into position before the railing. It
seemed neither right nor possible that he achieved
the maneuver under his own power alone. His face,
as Carmel mentally decapitated him, and scrutinized
that portion of his anatomy separately from the
whole, gave no impression of any sort of power
whatever. It was a huge putty-mask of placid vanity.
There was a great deal of head, bald and brightly
glistening; there was an enormous expanse of face
in which the eyes and nose seemed to have been
crowded in upon themselves by aggressive flesh; there
were chins, which seemed not so much physical part
of the face as some strange festoons hung under the
chin proper as barbaric adornments. On the whole,
Carmel thought, it was the most face she had ever
seen on one human being.</p>

<p>She replaced his head and considered him as a
whole. It is difficult to conceive of the word <i>dapper</i>
as applying to a mastodon, but here it applied perfectly.
His body began at his ears, the neck having
long since retired from view in discouragement. He
ended in tiny feet dressed in patent-leather ties. Between
ears and toes was merely expanse, immensity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
a bubble of human flesh. One thought of a pan of
bread dough which had been the recipient of too
much yeast.... The only dimension in which he
was lacking was height, which was just, for even
prodigal nature cannot bestow everything.</p>

<p>He peered at Carmel, then at Evan Bartholomew
Pell, with an unwinking baby stare, and then spoke
suddenly, yet carefully, as if he were afraid his voice
might somehow start an avalanche of his flesh.</p>

<p>“I am Abner Fownes,” he said in a soft, effeminate
voice.</p>

<p>“I am Carmel Lee,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Yes.... Yes.... I took that for granted—for
granted. I have come to see you—here I am.
Mountain come to Mohammed—eh?...” He
paused to chuckle. “Very uppity young woman.
Wouldn’t come when I sent for you—so had to come
to you. What’s <i>he</i> doing here?” he asked, pointing
a sudden, pudgy finger at Evan Pell.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pell is working for the paper.”</p>

<p>“Writing more letters?” He did not pause for an
answer. “Mistake, grave mistake—printing letters
like that. Quiet, friendly town—Gibeon. Everybody
friends here.... Stir up trouble. It hurt me.”</p>

<p>Carmel saw no reason to reply.</p>

<p>“Came to advise you. Friendly advice.... I’m
interested in this paper—er—from the viewpoint of
a citizen and—er—financially. Start right, Miss Lee.
Start right. Catch more flies with honey than with
vinegar.... You commenced with vinegar. Nobody
likes it. Can’t make a living with vinegar. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
run a paper in Gibeon you must be diplomatic—diplomatic.
Can’t expect me to support financially a
paper which isn’t diplomatic, can you? Now can
you?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by being diplomatic?”</p>

<p>“Why—er taking advice—yes, taking advice.”</p>

<p>“From whom?”</p>

<p>His little eyes opened round as if in great astonishment.</p>

<p>“From me,” he said. “People in Gibeon—er—repose
great confidence in my judgment. Great
confidence.”</p>

<p>“What sort of advice?”</p>

<p>“All sorts,” he said, “but principally about what
you print about different things.... Now, I should
have advised you against printing this young man’s
letter.”</p>

<p>“Would you have advised me against printing anything
about the threatening note I found on my
desk?”</p>

<p>“Ah—sense of humor, miss. Boyish prank....
Jokers in Gibeon. Town’s full of ’em.... Best-natured
folks in the world, but they love to joke and
to talk. Love to talk better than to joke. Um!...
Mountains out of molehills—that’s Gibeon’s specialty.
Mean no harm, Lord love you, not a particle—but
they’ll tell you <i>anything</i>. Not lying—exactly. Just
talk.”</p>

<p>“Is Sheriff Churchill’s disappearance just talk?”</p>

<p>“Um!... Sheriff Churchill—to be sure. Disappeared.
Um!... Gabble, gabble, gabble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Talk of murder is not gabble,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Ugly word.... Shouldn’t use it. Makes me
shiver.” He shivered like a gelatin dessert. “Forget
such talk. My advice—straight from the heart....
Stirs things up—things best forgot. Best let
rest for the sake of wife and children.... Paper
can’t live here without my support. Can’t be done.
Can’t conscientiously support a paper that stirs up
things.”</p>

<p>“Is that a threat, Mr. Fownes.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, no! Gracious, no! Just want to help....
Kind heart, Miss Lee. Always think of me as
a kind heart. Love to do things for folks....
Love to do things for <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Fownes. You hold a chattel
mortgage on this plant.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it. Not a breath of worry—cancel
it if you say so—cancel it this minute.”</p>

<p>“In consideration of what?”</p>

<p>“Why—you put it so sharplike, so direct. I
wasn’t thinking of consideration. Just being friendly
and helpful.... Public-spirited gift to Gibeon.
Newspaper a wonderful benefit to a town—the right
kind of a newspaper.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, of course. The right kind of a newspaper.</p>

<p>“Naturally you wouldn’t make so munificent a
gift to the wrong kind of newspaper. Is this the
right kind?”</p>

<p>“It always has been,” said Mr. Fownes.</p>

<p>“What made it the right kind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Your uncle—the former proprietor—relied on my
advice. Consulted with me daily.... During many
years his paper made few mistakes.”</p>

<p>“So, if I consult with you—daily—and act upon
your advice, I’m sure to have the right kind of a
paper, too?... And in that case you would cancel
the chattel mortgage?”</p>

<p>“To be sure—exactly.”</p>

<p>“But if, on the contrary, I should decide to run
this paper myself, as I see fit, without taking advice
from anybody, and printing what I think should be
printed?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fownes pondered this briefly. “Then,” he
said, “I should have to wait—and determine how
sound your judgment is.... I fear your sympathies—natural
sympathies for a young woman—sway
you.... Er ... as in the instance of this
young man. His letter was not kindly, not considerate.
It hurt people’s feelings. Then, it appears,
you have hired him.... I hope that step may be
reconsidered.... Gibeon—found this young man
unsatisfactory.”</p>

<p>“Would that have anything to do with—the chattel
mortgage?”</p>

<p>“It might—it might.”</p>

<p>“My uncle always followed your advice?”</p>

<p>“Ah ... implicitly.”</p>

<p>“He did not grow rich,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“He lived,” said Mr. Fownes, and blinked his little
eyes as he turned his placid gaze full upon her.</p>

<p>“I think you have made yourself clear, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Fownes. I shall think over what you have said—and
you will know my decision.”</p>

<p>“Consider well—er—from all angles.... Mountain
came to Mohammed....”</p>

<p>He commenced to warp himself away from the
railing, and slowly, ponderously, testing the security
of each foot before he trusted his weight to it, he
moved toward the door. There he paused, turned
his bulk, the whole of him, for it was quite impossible
for him to turn his head without his shoulders
going along with it, and smiled the most placid
smile Carmel ever saw. “Er—I am a widower,”
he said....</p>

<p>Carmel remained standing, her eyes following him
as he turned up the street. “What’s underneath it
all?” she said, aloud. “What’s it all about?”</p>

<p>Evan Pell turned in his chair and said, sharply,
“Textbooks have this merit at least—they can instruct
in the simplest rules of logic.”</p>

<p>“The fatuous idiot,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“It must be a great satisfaction,” said Evan, dryly,
“to understand human beings so thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I was admiring,” said Evan, “the unerring certainty
with which you arrived at Mr. Fownes’s true
character.”</p>

<p>She peered at him, searching for a trace of irony,
but his face was innocent, bland.</p>

<p>“Why does a wealthy man like Mr. Fownes—a
powerful man—give a thought to so insignificant a
thing as this paper?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“An interesting speculation—provided your premises
are true.”</p>

<p>“What premises?”</p>

<p>“Your major premise, so to speak—wealth.”</p>

<p>“Why, is he not rich?”</p>

<p>“All the indications bear you out.”</p>

<p>“He owns mills, and miles of timberland.”</p>

<p>“Um!... Am I to remain in your employ—or
shall you accept the—advice—of Mr. Fownes?”</p>

<p>“This is my paper. So long as it is mine I’m going
to try to run it. And if that man thinks he can
threaten me with his old chattel mortgage, he’s going
to wake up one bright morning to find his mistake.
Maybe he can take this paper away from me,
but until he does it’s mine.... You are working
for me, Mr. Pell.”</p>

<p>“Very gratifying.... In which case, if you mean
what you say, and if I, with so many years wasted
upon books, as you say, may offer a word of advice,
this would be it: Find out who owns the Lakeside
Hotel.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “Protracted study of
the various sciences may be folly, but it does train the
mind to correct observation and in the ability to arrange
and classify the data observed. It teaches how
to move from cause to effect. It teaches that things
which equal the same thing are equal to each other.”</p>

<p>“What is the Lakeside Hotel?”</p>

<p>“A resort of sordid reputation some three miles
from town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“And who owns it?”</p>

<p>“Jonathan Bangs, colloquially known as Peewee,
is the reputed owner.”</p>

<p>“And what has that to do with Abner Fownes?”</p>

<p>“That,” he said, “is a matter which has aroused
my curiosity for some time.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARMEL was not long in discovering Gibeon’s
attitude toward advertising. The local merchants
regarded it much as they did taxes, the <i>dull
season</i>, so called (for in Gibeon’s business world there
were only two seasons, the dull and the busy) and inventory
sales. All were inevitable, in the course of
nature, and things which always had and always
would happen. One advertised, not with enthusiasm
and in expectancy of results, but because men in
business did advertise. Smith Brothers’ grocery
bore reluctantly the expense of a four-inch double-column
display which was as unchanging as the laws
of the Medes and Persians. It stated, year in and
year out, that Smith Brothers were the headquarters
for staple and fancy groceries. The advertisement
was as much a part of their business as the counter.
The Busy Big Store was more energetic; its copy
was changed every year on the 1st of January. Seven
years before, Miss Gammidge let it be known through
the columns of the <i>Free Press</i> that she was willing
to sell to the public millinery and fancy goods, and
that statement appeared every week thereafter without
change of punctuation mark. The idea that one
attracted business by means of advertising was one
which had not penetrated Gibeon, advertising was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
business rite, just as singing the Doxology was an
indispensable item in the service of the local Presbyterian
church. It was done, as cheaply and inconspicuously
as possible, and there was an end of it.</p>

<p>As for subscribers, they were hereditary. Just as
red hair ran in certain families, subscribing to the
paper ran in others. It is doubtful if anybody took
in the paper because he wanted it; but it was tradition
for some to have the <i>Free Press</i>, and therefore
they subscribed. It was useful for shelf covering.
Red hair is the exception rather than the rule;
so were subscribing families.</p>

<p>Carmel pondered deeply over these facts. If, she
said to herself, all the merchants advertised as they
should advertise, and if all the inhabitants who should
subscribe did subscribe, then the <i>Free Press</i> could
be made a satisfactorily profitable enterprise. How
might these desirable results be obtained? She was
certain subscribers might be gotten by making the
paper so interesting that nobody could endure to
wait and borrow his neighbor’s copy; but how to
induce merchants to advertise she had not the remotest
idea.</p>

<p>There was the bazaar, for instance, which did not
advertise at all; the bank did not advertise; the two
photographers did not advertise; the bakery did not
advertise. She discussed the matter with Tubal and
Simmy, who were not of the least assistance, though
very eager. She did not discuss it with Prof. Evan
Bartholomew Pell because that member of the staff
was engaged in writing a snappy, heart-gripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
article on the subject of “Myths and Fables Common
to Peoples of Aryan Derivation.” It was his
idea of up-to-date journalism, and because Carmel
could think of nothing else to set him to work at,
she permitted him to continue.</p>

<p>“Advertising pays,” she said to Tubal. “How can
I prove it to these people?”</p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Lady. Jest go tell ’em. Mebby
they’ll believe you.”</p>

<p>“They won’t b’lieve nothin’ that <i>costs</i>,” said
Simmy, with finality.</p>

<p>“I’m going out to solicit advertising,” she said,
“and I’m not coming back until I get something.”</p>

<p>“Um!... G’-by, Lady. Hope we see you
ag’in.”</p>

<p>In front of the office Carmel hesitated, then turned
to the left. The first place of business in that direction
was identified by a small black-and-gold sign
protruding over the sidewalk, making it known that
here one might obtain the handiwork of Lancelot
Bangs, Photographer. In glass cases about the doors
were numerous specimens of Lancelot’s art, mostly
of cabinet size, mounted on gilt-edged cards. Mr.
Bangs, it would appear, had few ideas as to the
posturing of his patrons. Gentlemen, photographed
alone, were invariably seated in a huge chair, the
left hand gripping the arm, inexorably, the right
elbow leaning upon the other arm, and the head
turned slightly to one side as if the sitter were thinking
deep thoughts of a solemn nature. Ladies stood,
one foot advanced, hands clasped upon the stomach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
in order that the wedding ring might show plainly;
with chins dipped a trifle downward and eyes lifted
coyly, which, in dowagers of sixty, with embonpoints
and steel-rimmed spectacles, gave a highly desirable
effect.</p>

<p>Carmel studied these works of art briefly and then
climbed the uncarpeted stairs. Each step bore upon
its tread a printed cardboard sign informative of some
business or profession carried on in the rooms above,
such as Jenkins &amp; Hopper, Fire Insurance; Warren
P. Bauer, D.D.S., and the like. The first door at
the top, curtained within, was labeled Photographic
Studio, and this Carmel entered with some trepidation,
for it was her first business call. As the door
swung inward a bell sounded in the distance. Carmel
stood waiting.</p>

<p>Almost instantly a youngish man appeared from
behind a screen depicting a grayish-blue forest practically
lost to view in a dense fog. At sight of
Carmel he halted abruptly and altered his bearing
and expression to one of elegant hospitality. He
settled his vest cautiously, and passed his hand over
his sleek hair daintily to reassure himself of its perfect
sleekness. Then he bowed.</p>

<p>“A-aa-ah.... Good morning!” he said, tentatively.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bangs?”</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>“I am Miss Lee, proprietor of the <i>Free Press</i>.”</p>

<p>“Pleased to make your acquaintance, Miss Lee,
though, of course, I knew who you were right off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
I guess everybody in town does,” he added. “We
don’t have many move here that would photograph
as well as you would—bust or full length.... What
kin I do for you?”</p>

<p>“I came to talk to you about advertising in the
<i>Free Press</i>.”</p>

<p>“Advertising!” Manifestly he was taken aback.
“Why, I haven’t ever advertised. Haven’t anythin’
to advertise. I just take pictures.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you advertise that?”</p>

<p>“Why—everybody knows I take pictures. Be
kind of funny to tell folks what everybody knows.”
He laughed at the humor of it in a very genteel way.</p>

<p>“You would like to take more pictures than you
do, wouldn’t you? To attract more business.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, folks don’t get their pictures taken like
they buy flour. Uh-uh!... They got to have a
reason to have ’em taken—like a weddin’, or an engagement,
or gettin’ to be sixty year old, or suthin’
sim’lar. No. Folks in Gibeon don’t just go off and
get photographed on the spur of the moment, like
you might say. They hain’t got any <i>reason</i> to.”</p>

<p>“There are lots of people here who have never
been photographed, aren’t there?”</p>

<p>“Snags of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Then why not induce them to do it at once?”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done, no more’n you can induce a man
to have a weddin’ anniversary when he hain’t got
one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“I believe it could. I think we could put the idea
into their heads and then offer them inducements
to do it right off.”</p>

<p>He shook his head stubbornly and glanced down
at the crease in his trousers. Carmel’s eyes twinkled
as she regarded him, for he was quite the dressiest
person she had seen in Gibeon. He was painstakingly
dressed, laboriously dressed. He was so much
dressed that you became aware of his clothes before
you became aware of him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bangs,” she said, “you look to me like a man
who is up to the minute—like a man who would
never let a chance slip past him.”</p>

<p>“Folks do give me credit for keepin’ my eyes
open.”</p>

<p>“Then I believe I can make you a proposition you
can’t refuse. I just want to prove to you what advertising
can do for your business. Now, if you will
let me write an ad for you, and print it, I can show
you, and I know it. How much are your best cabinet
photographs?”</p>

<p>“Twelve dollars a dozen.”</p>

<p>“Would there be a profit at ten dollars?”</p>

<p>“Some—<i>some</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then let me advertise that for a week you will
sell your twelve-dollar pictures for ten. The advertisement
will cost five dollars. If my advertisement
brings you enough business so your profit will
be double that amount, you are to pay for the ad.
If it is less, you needn’t pay.... But if it does
bring in so many customers, you must agree to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
your ad every week for three months.... Now, I—I
<i>dare</i> you to take a chance.”</p>

<p>Now there was one thing upon which Lancelot
Bangs prided himself, and that was his willingness
to take a chance. He had been known to play cards
for money, and the horse races of the vicinity might
always count upon him as a patron. Beside that, he
had a natural wish to impress favorably this very
pretty girl whose manner and clothes and bearing
coincided with his ideal of a “lady.”</p>

<p>“I’ll jest go you once,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, and was turning toward the
door when Lancelot arrested her.</p>

<p>“Er—I wonder if I could get your opinion?” he
said. “You come from where folks know what’s
what.... This suit, now.” He turned completely
around so she might view it from all sides. “How
does it stand up alongside the best dressers where
you come from?”</p>

<p>“It—it is very impressive, Mr. Bangs.”</p>

<p>“Kind of figgered it would be. Had it made to
order. Got a reputation to keep up, even though
there’s them that tries to undermine it. Folks calls
me the best-dressed man in Gibeon, and I feel it’s
my duty to live up to it.... Well, I ain’t vain.
Jest kind of public duty. Now George, he’s set out
to be the best-dressed man, and so’s Luke. That’s
why I got this suit and this shirt and tie. I aim to
show ’em.”</p>

<p>“I should say you were doing it,” said Carmel.
“And who are Luke and George?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“George Bogardus is the undertaker, and Luke
Smiley clerks in the bank.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen them,” said Carmel, “but I’m certain
you haven’t the least cause for worry.”</p>

<p>“Would you call this suit <i>genteel</i>?”</p>

<p>“That’s the word. It is exactly the word. It—it’s
the most genteel suit I ever saw.”</p>

<p>She was about to leave when a rapping on the
back door of the studio attracted Mr. Bangs’s attention,
and attracted it so peculiarly that Carmel could
not but remark it with something more than curiosity.
If one can have suspicion of an individual
one does not know, with whose life and its ramifications
she is utterly unaware, Carmel was suspicious of
Mr. Bangs. It was not an active suspicion—it was
a vague suspicion. It resembled those vague odors
which sometimes are abroad in the air, odors too
faint to be identified, so adumbrant one cannot be
sure there is an odor at all.... Mr. Bangs, who
had been the picture of self-satisfaction, became furtive.
For the first time one ceased to be aware of
his clothes and focused upon his eyes....</p>

<p>“Er—pardon me a moment,” he said, in a changed
voice, and made overrapid progress to answer the
knock. It was inevitable that Carmel’s ears should
become alert.</p>

<p>She heard a door opened and the entrance of a
man who spoke in an attempted whisper, but not a
successful whisper. It was as if a Holstein bull had
essayed to whisper.</p>

<p>“Sh-sssh!” warned Mr. Bangs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“It’s here,” said the whisper. “Back your jitney
into the first tote road this side of the hotel, and then
mosey off and take a nap. Everything’ll be fixed
when you git back.”</p>

<p>“Sh-sssh!” Mr. Bangs warned a second time.</p>

<p>Carmel heard the door open and close again, and
Mr. Bangs returned.</p>

<p>“Express Parcel,” he said, with that guilty air
which always accompanies the unskillful lie.</p>

<p>The zest for selling advertising space had left Carmel;
she wanted to think, to be alone and to consider
various matters. She felt a vague apprehension, not
as to herself, but of something malign, molelike,
stealthy, which dwelt in the atmosphere surrounding
Gibeon. Perfunctorily she took her leave, and, instead
of pursuing her quest, returned to her desk
and sat there staring at the picture above her head.</p>

<p>Gibeon! She was thinking about Gibeon. The
town had ceased to be a more or less thriving rural
community, peopled by simple souls who went about
their simple, humdrum round of life pleasantly, if
stodgily. Rather the town and its people became a
protective covering, a sort of camouflage to conceal
the real thing which enacted itself invisibly. She
wondered if Gibeon itself realized. It seemed not
to. It laughed and worked and went to church and
quarreled about line fences and dogs and gossiped
about its neighbors as any other town did.... Perhaps,
unaccustomed to the life, excited by new environment,
she had given too great freedom to her
imagination.... She did not believe so. No.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Something was going on; some powerful evil influence
was at work, ruthless, malevolent. Its face
was hidden and it left no footprints. It was capable
of murder!... What was this thing? What was
its purpose? What activity could include the doing
away with a sheriff and the services of a rural fop
like Lancelot Bangs?...</p>

<p>Carmel was young. She was dainty, lovely. Always
she had been shielded and protected and petted—which,
fortunately, had not impaired the fiber of her
character.... Now, for the first time, she found
herself staring into the white, night eyes of one of
life’s grim realities; knew herself to be touched by
it—and the knowledge frightened her....</p>

<p>Evan Bartholomew Pell stayed her unpleasant
thoughts, and she was grateful to him.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee—I have—ah—been engaged upon a
computation of some interest—academically. It is,
of course, based upon an arbitrary hypothesis—nevertheless
it is instructive.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Carmel, wearily.</p>

<p>“We take for our hypothesis,” said Evan, “the
existence of a number of men willing to evade or
break the law for profit. Having assumed the existence
of such an association, we arrive upon more
certain ground.... Our known facts are these.
Intoxicating liquor is prohibited in the United States.
Second, intoxicants may be bought freely over the
Canadian line. Third, the national boundary is some
twenty miles distant. Fourth, whisky, gin, et cetera,
command exceedingly high prices in the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
States. I am informed liquor of excellent quality
commands as much as a hundred dollars per dozen
bottles, and less desirable stock up to fifty and
seventy-five dollars. Fifth, these same liquors may
be bought for a fraction of that cost across the line.
Now, we arrive at one of our conclusions. The hypothetical
association of lawless men, provided they
could smuggle liquor into this country, would realize
a remarkable percentage of profit. Deducting various
costs, I estimate the average profit per dozen
bottles would approximate thirty-five dollars. I
fancy this is low rather than excessive. One thousand
cases would fetch a profit of thirty-five thousand
dollars.... Let us suppose an efficient company
engaged in the traffic. They would smuggle
into the country a thousand cases a month.... In
that case their earnings would total three hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.... Ahem!... Interesting,
is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Carmel, “but what set you thinking
about it?”</p>

<p>Evan peered at her gravely through his spectacles,
as he might peer at some minute zoological specimen
through a microscope, and was long in replying.</p>

<p>“I—er—was merely wondering,” he said, “if a life
of lawlessness could not offer greater rewards than—ah—respectable
journalism.”</p>

<p>“Are you proposing that I become a—rum
runner?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said Evan Bartholomew, “not precisely.
I was, so to speak, offering you an opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to exercise your reason.... If exercise is
salubrious for the body, why not for the mind?” He
cleared his throat and turned his back upon her
abruptly.</p>

<p>“The various sciences you have studied,” she said,
sharply, “did not include good manners.”</p>

<p>“As I understand it,” said Evan, “our relations
are not social, but purely of a business nature. If I
am in error, I beg you to correct me.”</p>

<p>Carmel smiled. What a strange, self-centered,
egotistical little creature he was! So this was what
became of infant prodigies.... They dried up into
dusty intellect, lived for intellect alone; became a
species of hermit living in social poverty in the cave
of their own skulls!</p>

<p>“I cannot,” she said, “fancy you in any relation
which remotely approximated social.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” said Professor Pell.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was on the morning following the issuance of
the second publication of the <i>Free Press</i> under
Carmel’s editorship that she became uneasily aware
of a marked scrutiny of herself by Evan Bartholomew
Pell. There was nothing covert about his study
of her; it was open and patent and unabashed. He
stared at her. He watched her every movement,
and his puckered eyes, wearing their most studious
expression, followed her every movement. It was
the first sign of direct interest he had manifested in
her as a human being—as distinct from an employer—and
she wondered at it even while it discomfited
her. Even a young woman confident in no mean
possession of comeliness may be discomfited by a
persistent stare. It was not an admiring stare; rather
it was a researchful stare, a sort of anatomical stare.
Being a direct young person, Carmel was about to
ask him what he meant by it, when he spared her
the trouble.</p>

<p>“Er—as I was approaching the office this morning,”
he said, in an especially dry and scholarly voice,
“I chanced to overhear a young man make the following
remark, namely: ‘Mary Jenkins is a pretty girl.’...
Now it is possible I have encountered that expression
on numerous occasions, but this is the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
time I have become conscious of it, and curious concerning
it.”</p>

<p>“Curious?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.... As to its significance and—er—its
causes. I have been giving consideration to it. It
is not without interest.”</p>

<p>“Pretty girls,” said Carmel, somewhat flippantly,
“are always supposed to be of interest to men.”</p>

<p>“Um!... I have not found them so. That is
not the point. What arrested my thought was this:
What constitutes prettiness? Why is one girl pretty
and another not pretty? You follow me?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Prettiness, as I understand it, is a quality of the
personal appearance which gives to the beholder a
pleasurable sensation.”</p>

<p>“Something of the sort.”</p>

<p>“Ah.... Then, what causes it? It is intangible.
Let us examine concrete examples. Let us stand
side by side Mary Jenkins, who is said to possess
this quality, and—shall we say?—Mrs. Bogardus,
who is reputed not to possess it. Why is one pretty
and the other quite the opposite of pretty?” He shook
his head. “I confess I had never become consciously
aware of this difference between women....”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>He opened his eyes in mild surprise at the force of
her exclamation.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” he said, patiently, “I do
not recall taking special notice of any individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
woman.... As to this matter of prettiness—what
constitutes it? What assembling of features and
contours create a pleasant sensation in the beholder,
and why?... Perhaps you noted how I have been
scrutinizing you this morning?”</p>

<p>“I most certainly did.”</p>

<p>“Um!... It was for the purpose of determining
if your appearance aroused pleasant sensations
in myself.”</p>

<p>“And did it?”</p>

<p>He wrinked his eyes behind his glasses and pushed
stiff fingers through his hair. “It is difficult to determine
with accuracy, or to state in terms the degree
of pleasure derived, but I am almost certain that I
derive a mild satisfaction from regarding you.”</p>

<p>“I—I am overwhelmed,” said Carmel, and with
abruptness she passed through the wicket and out
into the composing room, where she sat down in
Tubal’s rope-bottomed chair, breathless with laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tubal,” she said, “what sort of creature is
he anyhow?”</p>

<p>“The Prof.?”</p>

<p>She nodded weakly.</p>

<p>“H’m.... The Prof.’s a kind of cabbage that
never headed up,” said Tubal, with finality. “He’s
got all the roots and leaves, like that kind of a cabbage,
and, sim’lar, he hain’t no idee how to fold ’em
up, or why he’s a cabbage, nor that cabbages is the
chief ingredient of sauerkraut.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Carmel, “that’s it.” And for a long
time after that she continued to think of Evan Pell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
as a cabbage which had grown to maturity without
fulfilling a cabbage’s chief object in life, which
is to head. “Only,” she said, “he’s really just the
opposite. He’s never done anything <i>but</i> come
to head. He’s comatose from his eyebrows to his
toes.”</p>

<p>The second issue of the <i>Free Press</i> had brought
faint encouragement. There had been a slight increase
in advertising, due to Carmel’s solicitations,
but her pleasure in this growth was somewhat dimmed
by a guilty feeling that it was not due to any merit
of the paper, or of her solicitations, but to a sort of
rudimentary gallantry on the part of a few merchants....
Perhaps half a dozen men had lounged
in to subscribe, investing a dollar and a half in curiosity....
But, to put the worst face on it, she had
held her own.</p>

<p>She really felt she had improved the paper. The
columns of personals, which had been intrusted to
Evan Pell, were full of items. He had shown an
unusual aptitude for observing the minutiæ of the
community. Having observed, he would have reported
in the language of a treatise on sociology, but
Carmel referred him to the files, and admonished
him to study the style of the late Uncle Nupley.
This he had done grimly, ironically, and the result
was a parrotlike faithfulness.... He had also read
and corrected all the proofs, to the end that the sensibilities
of the community be not offended by grammatical
<i>gaucheries</i>.</p>

<p>He had been offended close to resignation when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Carmel insisted upon running, in inch-tall, wooden
type—across the top of the first page—this query:</p>

<p class="center">WHO IS THE HANDSOMEST MAN IN GIBEON</p>

<p>That was her great idea, born of her interview
with Lancelot Bangs. “If papers run beauty contests
for women,” she said, “why not run handsome
contests for men?... Anyhow, it’ll be fun, and
I’m entitled to a little pleasure. Men are vain. It
will make talk, and talk is advertising, and advertising
pays.”</p>

<p>Evan inveighed against the scheme as undignified,
stultifying, and belittling to a dignified profession.</p>

<p>“If it brings in subscriptions—and dollars,” said
Carmel, “we should worry!”</p>

<p>Evan closed his eyes in pain. “<i>We should worry!</i>...
I beg of you.... That barbaric phrase! The
basest <i>argot</i>. Our newspapers should be the palladium
of the purity of the language. If such expressions
are tolerated——” He stopped abruptly
because his mind could not encompass the horrors
which would result from their toleration.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I’m going to do it—and you’ll see. A
regular voting. Coupons and everything. We’ll
have a six months’ subscription worth fifty votes, a
year’s subscription worth a hundred votes.”</p>

<p>“But—er—who will they vote for?”</p>

<p>“Just wait,” she said.</p>

<p>Following which she proceeded with enthusiasm.
First she printed the rules of the contest in the <i>Free
Press</i>, and then she went to Tubal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“I want to stick things up all over the township,”
she said, “telling about it.”</p>

<p>“We got a mess of yaller stock,” he said. “You
write it out and I’ll print it, and we’ll make the Prof.
go and paste ’em up.”</p>

<p>So it was done, and on a day Gibeon awoke to
find itself placarded with large yellow notices making
it know that the <i>Free Press</i> was in a fever to
discover who was considered the handsomest man
in town, and to read the paper for particulars. Carmel
was right—it caused talk....</p>

<p>In other matters she was feeling her way, and
the way was not plain to her. Of petty news
there was aplenty, and this she printed. She also
printed a trifling item about a traveling salesman
who had been “making” the territory for years
in a buggy, and who had been detected in the act
of smuggling a few bottles of liquor over the
border in his sample case, thus adding to a meager
income.</p>

<p>“There’s your vast liquor traffic,” she said to Evan
Pell, “a poor, fat little drummer with six bottles of
whisky.”</p>

<p>“Um!... Who arrested him?”</p>

<p>“Deputy Jenney,” she said.</p>

<p>“There is,” said Evan, “a phrase which I have
noted in the public prints. It is, ‘strangling competition.’”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—if you were engaged in a—profitable
enterprise, and some individual—er—encroached,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
you would abate him, would you not? That is the
ethics of business.”</p>

<p>“Do you infer this drummer was abated as a competitor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not in the least—not in the least!” He spoke
airily, as one who disposes of a troublesome child.</p>

<p>The incident, small as it was, troubled her. Evan
Pell, by his cryptic utterances, set her thinking....
If her imagination had not tricked her wholly
there was a reticence about Gibeon; there was something
Gibeon hid away from her.... A thing was
transpiring which Gibeon did not wish to be known—at
least the powerful in Gibeon.... She had
encountered whisperings and slynesses.... She
laughed at herself. She would be seeing specters
presently, she told herself.... But there was the
disappearance of Sheriff Churchill. There was the
warning note to herself. There were many petty
incidents such as the one in Lancelot Bangs’s studio.
But why connect them with illicit traffic in intoxicants?...
It was absurd to imagine an entire
town debauched by the gainfulness of whisky running....
It were a matter best left alone.</p>

<p>And so, pursuing her policy of feeling her way,
the current issue of the <i>Free Press</i> was quite innocuous—save
for what is known technically as a
“follow-up” on the subject of Sheriff Churchill, and
an editorial in which was pointed out the lethargy of
official Gibeon in assailing the mystery.</p>

<p>As she was leaving the hotel after luncheon that
day, she encountered Abner Fownes making his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
progress down the street. It was a slow, majestic
progress, and quite impressive. Mr. Fownes carried
himself with an air. He realized his responsibilities
as a personage, and proceeded with the air
of a statesman riding in a victoria through a cheering
crowd. He spoke affably and ostentatiously to
everyone, but when he met Carmel face to face, he
paused.</p>

<p>“Um!... A hum!... I have read the paper—read
it all.”</p>

<p>“I hope it pleased you.”</p>

<p>“It did not,” said Mr. Fownes.</p>

<p>“Indeed! What fault did you find?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t consult with me.... Told you to
consult with me.... Number of things shouldn’t
have been mentioned. Editorial on Churchill—bad
business.... Young woman, you can see past the
end of your nose.”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I make myself plain?”</p>

<p>“You did.”</p>

<p>“Um!... Hem!... No time for nonsense.
After this—want to see every line goes in that paper.”</p>

<p>“Before it is published?” Carmel was stirred to
antagonism, but forced herself to speak without
heat.</p>

<p>“Before it’s published.... I’ll tell you what to
print and what not to print.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, softly, “you will!”</p>

<p>“I own that paper—practically.... I let it live.
You’re dependent on me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Carmel’s eyes snapped now; she was angry. “I
fancied <i>I</i> owned the <i>Free Press</i>,” she said.</p>

<p>“Just so long as I let you—and I’ll let you as long
as you—edit it—er—conservatively.”</p>

<p>“And <i>conservatively</i> means so long as I print what
you want printed, and omit what you wish omitted?”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he said. “You’ve kept that schoolteaching
fellow after I told you not to.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and then she said, very
quietly and slowly, “I think, Mr. Fownes, that you
and I have got to come to an understanding.”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I’m getting at.”</p>

<p>“Very well, now please listen carefully, and I’m
sure you’ll understand.... At this moment I own
the <i>Free Press</i>. Until your chattel mortgage falls
due—and that is two months away—I shall continue
to own it.... During that time I shall edit it as
I see fit. I think that is clear.... I shall ask no
advice from you. I shall take no dictation from you.
What I believe should be printed, I shall print....
Good afternoon, Mr. Fownes.”</p>

<p>She brushed past him and walked rapidly toward
the office; Mr. Fownes stood for a moment frowning;
then he turned his round head upon his shoulders—apparently
there was no neck to assist in the process—and
stared after her. It was not an angry stare,
nor a threatening stare. Rather it was appraising.
If Carmel could have studied his face, and especially
his eyes, at that moment, she would have wondered
if he were so fatuous as she supposed. She might
even have asked herself if he were really, as certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
people in Gibeon maintained, nothing but a bumptious
figurehead, used by stronger men who worked
in his shadow.... There was something in Abner
Fownes’s eyes which was quite worthy of remark;
but perhaps the matter most worthy of consideration
was that he manifested no anger whatever—as a
vain man, a little man, bearded as he had been by a
mere girl, might have done....</p>

<p>He peered after her briefly, then, by a series of
maneuvers, set his face again in the direction he had
been traveling, and proceeded magnificently on his
way.... Carmel would have been more disturbed,
and differently disturbed, could she have seen into
the man’s mind and read what was passing in its
depths. His thoughts had not so much to do with
Carmel as an editor as with Carmel as a woman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARMEL entered the office of the <i>Free Press</i>,
after her encounter with Abner Fownes, in a
temper which her most lenient friend could not describe
as amiable. It was no small part of Carmel’s
charm that she could be unamiable interestingly.
Her tempers were not set pieces, like the Niagara
Falls display at a fireworks celebration. They did
not glow and pour and smoke until the spectators
were tired of them and wanted to see something else.
Rather they were like gorgeous aërial bombs which
rent the remote clouds with a detonation and lighted
the heavens with a multitude of colored stars. Sometimes
her choicest tempers were like those progressive
bombs which keep on detonating a half a dozen
times and illuminating with different colored stars
after each explosion. This particular temper was
one of her best.</p>

<p>“From now on,” she said to nobody in particular,
and not at all for the purpose of giving information,
“this paper is going to be run for one single purpose.
It’s going to do everything that pompous little fat
man, with his ears growing out of his shoulders,
doesn’t want it to. It’s going to hunt for things he
doesn’t like. It is going to annoy and plague and
prod him. If a paper like this can make a man like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
him uncomfortable, he’ll never know another peaceful
moment....”</p>

<p>Evan Pell looked up from his table—over the rims
of his spectacles—and regarded her with interest.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” he said. “And what, if I may ask, has
caused this—er—declaration of policy?”</p>

<p>“He looked at me,” Carmel said, “and he—he
wiggled all his chins at me.”</p>

<p>Tubal thrust his head through the doorway.
“What’d he do?” he demanded, belligerently. “If
he done anythin’ a gent shouldn’t do to a lady I’ll
jest ca’mly walk over there and twist three-four of
them chins clean off’n him.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would.... I wish you would....
But you mustn’t.... He gave me orders. He told
me I was to let him read every bit of copy which went
into this paper. He said I must have his O. K. on
everything I print.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Evan Pell. “And what did you
rejoin?”</p>

<p>“I told him this was my paper, and so long as it
was mine, I should do exactly what I wanted with it,
and then I turned my back and walked away leaving
him looking like a dressed-up mushroom—a fatuous
mushroom.”</p>

<p>“A new variety,” said Pell.</p>

<p>“I—I’ll make his life miserable for sixty days
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“If,” said Pell, “he permits you to continue for
sixty days.”</p>

<p>“I’ll continue, not for sixty days, but for years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and years and years—till I’m an old, gray-headed
woman—just to spite him. I’ll make this paper
pay! I’ll show him he can’t threaten me. I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Now, Lady,” said Tubal, “if I was you I’d set
down and cool off. If you’re spoilin’ fer a fight you
better go into it level-headed and not jest jump in
flailin’ your arms like a Frenchy cook in a tantrum.
Abner Fownes hain’t no infant to be spanked and put
to bed. If you calc’late to go after his scalp, you
better find out how you kin git a grip onto his hair.”</p>

<p>“And,” said Pell, “how you can prevent his—er—getting
a grip on yours.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’s as big a man as he thinks he
is,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“I have read somewhere—I do not recall the author
at the moment—a word of advice which might
apply to this situation. It is to the effect that one
should never underestimate an antagonist.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shan’t. I’ll cool down presently, and then
I’ll be as cold-blooded and calculating as anybody.
But right now I—I want to—stamp on his pudgy
toes.”</p>

<p>The telephone interrupted and Evan Pell put the
receiver to his ear. “... Yes, this is the <i>Free
Press</i>.... Please repeat that.... In Boston last
night?... Who saw him? Who is speaking?”
Then his face assumed that blank, exasperated look
which nothing can bring in such perfection as to have
the receiver at the other end of the line hung up in
one’s ear. He turned to Carmel.</p>

<p>“The person”—he waggled his thumb toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
instrument—“who was on the wire says Sheriff
Churchill was seen in Boston last night?”</p>

<p>“Alive?”</p>

<p>“Alive.”</p>

<p>“Who was it? Who saw him?”</p>

<p>“When I asked that—he hung up the receiver in
my ear.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it is true?”</p>

<p>“Um!... Let us scrutinize the matter in the
light of logic—which it is your custom to ridicule.
First, we have an anonymous communication.
Anonymity is always open to suspicion. Second, it
is the newspaper which is informed—not the authorities.
Third, it is the newspaper which has been showing
a curiosity as to the sheriff’s whereabouts—er—contrary
to the wishes of certain people....”</p>

<p>“Yes....”</p>

<p>“From these premises I would reason: first, that
the anonymous informer wishes the fact to be made
public; second, that he wishes this paper to believe
it; third, that, if the paper does believe it, it will cease
asking where the sheriff is and why; and fourth, that
if this report is credited, there will be no search by
anybody for a <i>corpus delicti</i>.”</p>

<p>“A <i>corpus delicti</i>! And what might that be?”</p>

<p>Evan Pell sighed with that impatient tolerance
which one exhibits toward children asking questions
about the obvious.</p>

<p>“It has been suggested,” he said, “that Sheriff
Churchill has been murdered. The first requisite in
the establishment of the commission of a murder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
is the production of the <i>corpus delicti</i>—the body of
the victim. If the body cannot be produced, or its
disposal established, there can be no conviction for
the crime. In short, a murder requires the fact of a
dead man, and until the law can be shown a veritable
body it is compelled, I imagine, to presume the victim
still alive. Here, you will perceive, the effort is to
raise a presumption that Sheriff Churchill is not a
<i>corpus delicti</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t believe it?”</p>

<p>“Do you?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know. Poor Mrs. Churchill! For
her sake I hope it is true.”</p>

<p>“H’m!... If I were you, Miss Lee, I would
not inform Mrs. Churchill of this—without substantiation.”</p>

<p>“You are right. Nor shall I print it in the paper.
You believe some one is deliberately imposing upon
us?”</p>

<p>“My mind,” said Evan Pell, “has been trained for
years to seek the truth. I am an observer of facts,
trained to separate the true from the false. That is
the business of science and research. I think I have
made plain my reasons for doubting the truth of this
message.”</p>

<p>“So much so,” said Carmel, “that I agree with
you.”</p>

<p>Evan smiled complacently. “I fancied you could
not do otherwise,” he said. “Perhaps you will be
further convinced if I tell you I am quite certain I
recognized the voice which gave the message.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Are you sure? Who was it?”</p>

<p>“I am certain in my own mind, but I could not
take my oath in a court of law.... I believe the
voice was that of the little hunchback known locally
as Peewee Bangs.”</p>

<p>“The proprietor of the Lakeside Hotel?”</p>

<p>Evan nodded.</p>

<p>“What is this Lakeside Hotel?” Carmel asked.
“I’ve heard it mentioned, and somehow I’ve gotten
the idea that it was—peculiar.”</p>

<p>Tubal interjected an answer before Evan Pell
could speak. “It’s a good place for sich as you be to
keep away from. Folks drives out there in automobiles
from the big town twenty-thirty mile off, and
has high jinks. Before prohibition come in folks
said Peewee run a blind pig.”</p>

<p>“He seems very friendly with the local politicians.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” snorted Tubal.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand Gibeon,” Carmel said. “Of
course I haven’t been here long enough to know it
and to know the people, but there’s something about
it which seems different from other little towns I’ve
known. The people look the same and talk the same.
There are the same churches and lodges and the reading
club and its auxiliaries, and I suppose there is
the woman’s club which is exclusive, and all that.
But, somehow, those things, the normal life of the
place, affect me as being all on the surface, with
something secret going on underneath.... If
there is anything hidden, it must be hidden from
most of the people, too. The folks must be decent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
honest, hardworking. Whatever it is, they don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“What gives you such an idea?” Evan Pell asked,
with interest.</p>

<p>“It’s a feeling—instinct, maybe. Possibly it’s because
I’m trying to find something, and imagine it
all. Maybe I’ve magnified little, inconsequential
things.”</p>

<p>“What has all this to do with Abner Fownes?”</p>

<p>“Why—nothing. He seems to be a rather typical
small-town magnate. He’s egotistical, bumptious,
small-minded. He loves importance—and he’s rich.
The professional politicians know him and his weaknesses
and use him. He’s a figurehead—so far as
actual things go, with a lot of petty power which he
loves to exercise.... He’s a bubble, and, oh, how
I’d love to prick him!”</p>

<p>Evan bowed to her with ironical deference. “Remarkable,”
he said. “A clean-cut, searching analysis.
Doubtless correct. You have been studying him
cursorily for a matter of days, but you comprehend
him to the innermost workings of his mind.... I,
a trained observer, have watched and scrutinized
Abner Fownes for a year—and have not yet reached
a conclusion. May I compliment you, Miss Lee?”</p>

<p>Carmel’s eyes snapped. “You may,” she said, and
then closed her lips determinedly.</p>

<p>“You were going to say?” Evan asked, in his most
irritating, pedagogical tone.</p>

<p>“I was going to say that you have mighty little to
be supercilious about. You don’t know any more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
about this man than I do, and you’ve been here a
year. You don’t like him because he hurt your
vanity, and you’re so crusted over with vanity that
whatever is inside of it is quite lost to sight....
He had you discharged as superintendent of schools,
and it rankles.... It’s childish, like that letter of
yours.... Oh, you irritate me.”</p>

<p>“Er—at any rate you have the quality of making
yourself clear,” he said, dryly, not offended, she was
surprised to note, but rather amused and tolerant.
He was so cocksure, so wrapped up in himself and his
abilities, so egotistical, that no word of criticism
could reach and wound him. Carmel wanted to
wound him, to see him wince. She was sorry for
him because she could perceive the smallness, the
narrowness, the poverty of his life; yet, because she
felt, somehow, that his character was of his own
planning and constructing, and because it was so
eminently satisfactory to her, that it was a duty to
goad him into a realization of his deficiencies. Evan
Pell did not seem to her a human being, a man, so
much as a dry-as-dust mechanism—an irritating little
pedant lacking in all moving emotions except boundless
vanity.</p>

<p>She had taken him into the office, half from sympathy,
half because somebody was needed and he
was the only help available. At times she regretted
it. Now she leaned forward to challenge him.</p>

<p>“You’ve boasted about your abilities as a trained
investigator,” she said. “Very well, then, investigate.
That’s the business of a reporter. Gibeon is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
your laboratory. You’ll find it somewhat different
to get at facts hidden in human brains than to discover
the hidden properties of a chemical or to
classify some rare plant or animal.... I haven’t a
trained mind. I wasn’t an infant prodigy. I haven’t
spent my lifetime in educating my brain out of all
usefulness, but I can see there’s something wrong
here. Now, Mr. Pell, take your trained faculties out
and discover what it is. There’s investigation worth
while.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure,” said Evan, “you will have the
courage to publish what I find?”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. “There’s no use talking
about that,” she said, “until you find something.”</p>

<p>“What,” he said, provocatively, “do you want me
to investigate first?”</p>

<p>“The one thing that cries out for investigation.
Find out why nothing is done to discover what happened
to Sheriff Churchill. Find out why he disappeared
and who made him disappear and what has
become of him. Fetch me the answers to these questions
and I’ll take back all I’ve said—and apologize.”</p>

<p>“Has it—er—occurred to you that perhaps Sheriff
Churchill disappeared because he—investigated
too much?”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid?” she asked.</p>

<p>He wrinkled his brows and peered at her through
his spectacles, and then, nonplused her by answering,
calmly, “I rather fancy I am. Yes, now I come to
give consideration to my emotions, I find I am
apprehensive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Then,” she said, with a shrug, “we will forget
about it.”</p>

<p>“You are trying,” he said, “to make me feel
ashamed because I am afraid. It is useless. I shall
not be ashamed. It is natural I should be afraid.
Self-preservation dictates fear. The emotion of fear
was implanted in man and animals as a—er—safety
device to prevent them from incurring dangers. No,
I am not in the least ashamed.... Fortunately,
reason has been provided as well as fear, and, consequently,
if reason counsels a course of action which
fear would veto, it is only natural that intelligence
should govern.... Reason should always control
emotion. Therefore, apprehensive as I am of unpleasant
consequences to myself, I shall proceed with
the investigation as indicated.” His tone was final.
There was no boasting in his statement, only the
logical presentation of a fact. He was afraid, but
his reason indicated to him that it was worth his
while to subject himself to the hazards of the situation.
Therefore he subordinated fear.</p>

<p>But Carmel—responsibility sat upon her heavily in
that moment. She had ordered or goaded a human
being into risking his person, perhaps his life. That
phase of it had not presented itself to her. She was
sending a man into danger, and the responsibility of
her doing so arose stark before her.</p>

<p>“I—I have no right,” she said, hesitatingly. “I
was wrong. I cannot allow you to put yourself in
danger.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” said Evan Pell, “you have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
vote in the matter. I have made the decision....
Of course, you may dispense with my services, but
that will not affect my conduct. I shall find out
what became of Sheriff Churchill and put myself
in a position to lay before the proper authorities
substantiated facts covering all phases of his
disappearance.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>He raised his hand, palm toward her. “My decision
is final,” he said, with asperity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GIBEON was so accustomed to Abner Fownes
that it took him for granted, as if he were a
spell of weather, or the Opera House which had
been erected in 1881, or the river which flowed
through the town, tumultuously in spring and parsimoniously
in the heat of summer when its moisture
was most sorely needed. On the whole, Abner bore
more resemblance to the river than to either weather
or Opera House. He was tumultuous when he could
do most damage, and ran in a sort of trickle when
such genius as he had might be of greater service.
On the whole, the village was glad it possessed
Abner. He was its show piece, and they compared
him with the show citizens of adjacent centers of
population.</p>

<p>Your remote villages are conscious of their outstanding
personalities, and, however much they may
dislike them personally and quarrel with them in the
family, they flaunt them in the faces of outsiders and
boast of their eccentricities and take pride in their
mannerisms. So Gibeon fancied it knew Abner
Fownes from the meticulous crust in which his tailor
incased him inward to his exact geometrical center;
it was positive it comprehended his every thought
and perceived the motive for his every action. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the most part its attitude was tolerant. Gibeon
fancied it allowed Abner to function, and that it
could put a stop to his functioning whenever it desired.
The power of his money was appraised and
appreciated; but it was more than a little inclined
to laugh at his bumptious pretense of arbitrary power.
George Bogardus, furniture dealer and undertaker,
embalmed the public estimate in words and phrases.</p>

<p>“Abner,” said Bogardus, “figgers himself out to
be a hell of a feller, and it does him a sight of good
and keeps his appetite hearty—and, so fur’s <i>I</i> kin see,
’tain’t no detriment to nobody else.”</p>

<p>Gibeon had its moments of irritation when Abner
seemed to take too much for granted or when he
drove with too tight a check rein, but these were
ephemeral. On the whole, the town’s attitude was
to let Abner do it, and then to call him a fool for
his pains.</p>

<p>He was a native of Gibeon. His father before
him had moved to the town when it was only a four
corners in the woods, and had acquired, little by
little, timber and mills, which increased in size from
year to year. Gibeon had grown with the mills and
with the coming of the railroad. Old Man Fownes
had been instrumental in elevating it to the dignity
of county seat. He had vanished from the scene of
his activities when Abner was a young man, leaving
his son extraordinarily well off for that day.</p>

<p>Abner, as a youth, had belonged to that short,
stout class of men who are made fun of by the girls.
He was never able to increase his stature, but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
girth responded to excellent cookery. No man denied
him the attribute of industry in those early days,
and, as Gibeon judged, it was more by doggedness
and stodgy determination that he was enabled to
increase his inherited fortune than it was by the
possession of keen mental faculties.</p>

<p>For ten years Abner was satisfied to devote himself
to the husbanding and increasing of his resources.
At the end of that time, his wife having died, he
discovered to Gibeon an ambition to rule and a
predilection for county politics. It was made apparent
how he realized himself a figure in the world,
and tried to live up to the best traditions of such
personages as his narrow vision had enabled him to
catch glimpses of. He seemed, of a sudden, to cease
taking satisfaction in his moderate possessions and
to desire to become a man of commanding wealth.
He bought himself garments and caused himself to
become impressive. He never allowed himself an
unimpressive moment. Always he was before the
public and conducting himself as he judged the public
desired to see a personage conduct himself. By word
and act he asserted himself to be a personage, and
as the years went by the mere force of reiterated assertion
caused Gibeon to accept him at his own valuation....
He was patient.</p>

<p>The fact that fifty of every hundred male inhabitants
were on his payroll gave him a definite power
to start with. He used this power to its limit. It
is true that Gibeon laughed up its sleeve and said
that smarter men than Abner used him as an implement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
in the political workshop; but if this were true,
Abner seemed unconscious of it. What he seemed
to desire was the appearance rather than the substance.
It seemed to matter little to him who actually
made decisions so long as he was publicly credited
with making them. Yet, with all this, with all
Gibeon’s sure knowledge of his inner workings, it
was a little afraid of him because—well, because he
<i>might</i> possess some of the power he claimed.</p>

<p>So, gradually, patiently, year by year, he had
reached out farther and farther for money and for
political power until he was credited with being a
millionaire, and had at least the outward seeming of
a not inconsiderable Pooh-Bah in the councils of his
party.</p>

<p>The word “fatuous” did not occur in the vocabulary
of Gibeon. If it had seen the word in print
it could not have guessed its meaning, but it owned
colloquial equivalents for the adjective, and with
these it summed up Abner. He possessed other attributes
of the fatuous man; he was vindictive where
his vanity was touched; he was stubborn; he followed
little quarrels as if they had been blood feuds. In
all the ramifications of his life there was nothing
large, nothing daring, nothing worthy of the comment
of an intelligent mind. He was simply a commonplace,
pompous, inflated little man who seemed
to have found exactly what he wanted and to be
determined to squeeze the last drop of the juice of
personal satisfaction out of the realization of his
ambitions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>His home was indicative of his personality. It
was a square, red-brick house with an octagonal
cupola on its top. It boasted a drive and evergreens,
and on the lawn stood an alert iron buck. The cupola
was painted white and there was a lightning rod
which projected glitteringly from the top of it. You
knew the lightning rod was not intended to function
as a protection against electrical storms as soon as
you looked at it. It was not an active lightning rod
in any sense. It was a bumptious lightning rod
which flaunted itself and its ornamental brass ball,
and looked upon itself as quite capping the climax
of Abner Fownes’s displayful life. The whole house
impressed one as not being intended as a dwelling,
but as a display. It was not to live in, but to inform
passers-by that here was an edifice, erected at great
expense, by a personage. Abner lived there after a
fashion, and derived satisfaction from the house and
its cupola, but particularly from its lightning rod.
An elderly woman kept house for him.</p>

<p>Abner never came out of his house—he emerged
from it. The act was a ceremony, and one could
imagine he visualized himself as issuing forth between
rows of bowing servitors, or through a lane
of household troops in wonderful uniforms. Always
he drove to his office in a surrey, occupying
the back seat, erect and conscious, while his unliveried
coachman sagged down in the front seat,
sitting on his shoulder blades, and quite destroying
the effect of solemn state. Abner, however, was not
particular about lack of state except in his own person.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Perhaps he had arrived at the conclusion that
his own person was so impressive as to render negligible
the appearance of any contiguous externals.</p>

<p>It was his office, however, which, to his mind,
perfectly set him off. It was the setting for the
jewel which was himself, and it was a perfect
setting. The office knew it. It oozed self-importance.
It realized its responsibilities in being the
daily container for Abner Fownes. It was an overbearing
office, a patronizing office. It was quite
the most bumptious place of business imaginable;
and when Abner was in place behind his flat-topped
mahogany desk the room took on an air of complacency
which would be maddening to an irritated
proletariat. It was an impossible office for a lumberman.
It might have been the office of a grand duke.
Gibeon poked fun at the office, but boasted to
strangers about it. It had on its walls two pictures
in shadow boxes which were believed to be old masters
rifled from some European gallery. What the
pictures thought about themselves is not known, but
they put the best possible face on the matter and
pretended they had not been painted in a studio in
the loft of a furniture store in Boston. Their frames
were expensive. The walls were paneled with some
wood of a golden tone which Abner was reputed to
have imported for the purpose from South America.
The sole furniture was that occupied by Abner
Fownes—his desk and chair. There was no resting
place for visitors—they remained standing when admitted
to the presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>If Abner Fownes, for some purpose of his own,
with Machiavellian intelligence, had set out to create
for himself a personality which could be described
only by the word fatuous, he could not have done
better. Every detail seemed to have been planned
for the purpose of impressing the world with the
fact that he was a man with illusions of grandeur,
motivated by obstinate folly, blind to his silliness;
perfectly contented in the belief that he was a human
being who quite overshadowed his contemporaries.
If he had possessed a strong, determined, rapacious,
keen mind, determined upon surreptitious depredations
upon finance and morals, he could not have
chosen better. If he wished to set up a dummy
Abner which would assert itself so loudly and foolishly
as to render the real, mole-digging Abner invisible
to the human eye, he could not have wrought
more skillfully. He was a perfect thing; his life
was a perfect thing.... Many men, possessing
real, malevolent power, erect up clothes-horses to
function in their names. It was quite unthinkable
that such a man should set <i>himself</i> up as his own
stalking horse.</p>

<p>Abner sat before his desk, examining a sheaf of
tally sheets. They were not the tally sheets of his
own lumber yard, but figures showing the amount
of spruce and pine and birch and maple piled in numerous
mill yards throughout the state. Abner owned
this lumber. In the fall he had watched the price
of lumber decline until he calculated it had reached
a price from which it could only rise. Others had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
disagreed with him. Nevertheless, he had bought
and bought and bought, intent upon one <i>coup</i> which
should make him indeed the power in the lumber
industry of the country, which was his objective.
He had used all available funds and then had carried
his credit into the market, stretching it until it cried
for mercy. Now he owned enough cut lumber to
build a small city—and the price had continued to
drop. That morning’s market prices continued the
decline. Abner’s state of mind was not one to arouse
envy.</p>

<p>The sum of money he must lose if he sold at the
market represented something more than the total
of his possessions. Gibeon rated him as a millionaire.
That he was in difficulties was a secret which
he had been able to conceal for months—and being
who he was, and having created the myth of Abner
Fownes, he had been able to frown down inquisitive
bank officials and creditors and to maintain a very
presentable aspect of solvency. But Abner needed
money. He needed it daily and weekly. Payrolls
must be met; current overhead expenses must be
taken care of. Notes coming due must be reduced
where possible—and with all market conditions in
chaos Abner had early seen there could be no hope
of legitimate profit lifting him out of the trap into
which he had lowered himself.</p>

<p>His reasoning had been good, but he had not foreseen
what labor would do. In his lumber camps
through the winter of 1919-20 and the succeeding
winter, he had paid woodsmen the unprecedented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
wage of seventy-five to eighty-five dollars a month.
Some of his cutting he had jobbed, paying each individual
crew eight dollars a thousand feet for
cutting, hauling, and piling in the rollways. It had
seemed a thing impossible that six months should
see these same lumberjacks asking employment
at thirty-five dollars, with prospects of a drop of
five or six dollars more! With labor up, lumber
must go up. It had dropped below cost; now the
labor cost had dropped and he found himself holding
the bag, and it was a very cumbersome bag
indeed.</p>

<p>Therefore he required a steady flow of money in
considerable sums. It was a situation which no
fatuous, self-righteous man could handle. It called
for imagination, lack of righteousness, a cleverness
in device, a fearlessness of God and man, lawlessness,
daring. Honest methods of business could not save
him.... Abner Fownes was in a bad way....
And yet when money had been required it was produced.
He tided things over. He produced considerable
amounts from nowhere and there was no
inquiring mind to ask questions. They accepted the
fact. Abner always had controlled money, and it
was in no wise surprising that he should continue
to control money.... One thing is worthy of note.
Abner kept in his private safe a private set of books,
or rather, a single book. It was not large, but it was
ample for the purpose. In this book Abner’s own
gold fountain pen made entries, and of these entries
his paid bookkeepers in the office without had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
knowledge whatever. The books of Abner Fownes,
Incorporated, showed a story quite different from
that unfolded by the pages of the little red morocco
book in Abner’s safe.</p>

<p>There came a rap on the door, and Abner, with a
quick, instinctive movement of his whole gelatinous
body, became the Abner Fownes the village knew,
pompous, patronizingly urbane, insufferably self-satisfied.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said.</p>

<p>The door opened and Deputy Jenney quite filled
the opening. He stepped quickly inside, and closed
the door after him with elaborate caution.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so confounded careful,” Abner said.
“There’s nothing like a parade of carefulness to make
folks suspect something.”</p>

<p>“Huh!... Jest wanted to report we hain’t seen
nothin’ of that motortruck of your’n that was stole.”
He grinned broadly. “Figger to git some news of it
to-night—along about midnight, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Let Peewee know.”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“Er——” Abner assumed character again. “I
have heard stories of this Lakeside Hotel.... Blot
on the county.... Canker in our midst. Stories
of debauchery.... Corrupt the young.... Duty
of the prosecutor to investigate.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“I shall come out publicly and demand it,” said
Abner. “The place should be closed. I shall lead
a campaign against it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Deputy Jenney’s eyes grew so big the lids quite
disappeared in the sockets.</p>

<p>“Say——” he began.</p>

<p>“This Peewee Bangs—so called—should be driven
out. No telling. Probably sells whisky.... Do
you suppose he sells liquor, Deputy?”</p>

<p>“I—why—I don’t b’lieve Peewee’d do no sich
thing. No, sir.”</p>

<p>“I shall find out.... By the way, I note that
Lancelot Bangs has an advertisement in the <i>Free
Press</i>. Tell him to discontinue it—or his profits
will drop. Make it clear.”</p>

<p>“Say, that professor wrote a piece about me in
to-day’s paper. Can’t make out what he’s hittin’ at.
For two cents I’d lambaste him till he couldn’t drag
himself off on his hind laigs.”</p>

<p>“Er—no violence, Deputy....” Abner Fownes’s
lips drew together in an expression which was not
at all fatuous. “A paper can do great harm even in
a few issues,” he said. “That girl’s a stubborn
piece.” His eyes half closed. “What’s the professor
doing?”</p>

<p>“Snoopin’ around.”</p>

<p>Abner nodded. “If he could be induced—er—to
go away.”</p>

<p>“He kin,” said Mr. Jenney, “on the toe of my
boot.”</p>

<p>“Wrote a piece about you, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ’tend to his case,” said Mr. Jenney. “What
be you goin’ to do wuth that newspaper?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—Deputy, you wouldn’t have me—ah—interfere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
with the liberty of the press.... Palladium
of freedom. Free speech.... There was
nothing else, Deputy?”</p>

<p>“That’s all.”</p>

<p>“I—er—hope you recover my truck. Reward,
you know.”</p>

<p>Deputy Jenney grinned again, more broadly than
before, and left the room.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DEPUTY JENNEY was a big man. In his
stocking feet he stood a fraction more than six
feet and two inches, but he possessed more breadth
than even that height entitled him to. He was so
broad that, if you saw him alone, with no ordinary
individual beside him for comparison, he gave the
impression of being short and squat. His weight
was nearer three hundred than two hundred pounds.
He was not fat.</p>

<p>Most big men are hard to provoke. It is rarely
you find a giant who uses his size as a constant
threat. Such men are tolerant of their smaller fellows,
slow to anger, not given to bullying and meanness.
Deputy Jenney was a mean big man. He was
a blusterer, and it was a joy to him to use his fists.
You never knew where you stood with Deputy
Jenney, nor what unpleasant turn his peculiar mind
might give to conversation or circumstance. He was
easily affronted, not overly intelligent, and in his
mind was room for no more than a single idea at a
time. He was vain of his size and strength, and
his chief delight was in exhibiting it, preferably in
battle. So much for Deputy Jenney’s outstanding
characteristic.</p>

<p>As he left Abner Fownes’s office his humor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
unpleasant. It was unpleasant for two reasons, first
and foremost because he was afraid of Abner, and
it enraged him to be made afraid of anybody. Second,
he had been held up to ridicule in the <i>Free Press</i>
and he could not endure ridicule. So the deputy required
a victim, and Evan Bartholomew Pell seemed
to have selected himself for the rôle. If Jenney comprehended
the desires of Abner Fownes—and he fancied
he did in this case—he had been directed to do
what he could to induce Evan to absent himself
permanently from Gibeon.</p>

<p>He walked down the street fanning himself into
a rage—which was no difficult matter. His rages
were very much like the teams which draw fire
engines—always ready for business; trained to leap
from their stalls and to stand under the suspended
harness.... It was the noon hour, and as he arrived
at the door of the <i>Free Press</i> office it was
Evan Pell’s unpleasant fortune to be coming out to
luncheon. Deputy Jenney roared at him.</p>

<p>“Hey, you!” he bellowed.</p>

<p>Evan paused and peered up at the big man through
his round spectacles, a calm, self-sufficient, unemotional
little figure of a man. The word little is used
in comparison to Deputy Jenney, for the professor
was not undersized.</p>

<p>“Were you speaking to me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You’re the skunk that wrote that piece about me,”
shouted Deputy Jenney.</p>

<p>“I certainly wrote an article in which you were
mentioned,” said Evan, who, apparently, had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
the least idea he stood in imminent danger of
destruction.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach ye, confound ye!... I’ll show ye
how to git free with folkses’ names.” Here the
deputy applied with generous tongue a number of
descriptive epithets. “When I git through with
you,” he continued, “you won’t waggle a pen for a
day or two.” And then, quite without warning the
professor to make ready for battle, the deputy swung
his great arm, with an enormous open hand flailing
at its extremity, and slapped Evan just under his
left ear. Evan left the place on which he had been
standing suddenly and completely, bringing up in the
road a dozen feet away dazed, astounded, feeling as
if something had fallen upon him from a great
height. It was his first experience with physical
violence. Never before had a man struck him. His
sensations were conflicting—when his head cleared
sufficiently to enable him to perceive sensations. He
had been struck and knocked down! He, Evan
Bartholomew Pell, whose life was organized on a
plane high above street brawls, had been slapped on
the jaw publicly, had been tumbled head over heels
ignominiously!</p>

<p>He sat up dizzily and raised his hand to his eyes
as if to assure himself his spectacles were in place.
They were not. He stared up at Deputy Jenney
with vague bewilderment, and Deputy Jenney laughed
at him.</p>

<p>Then Evan lost track of events temporarily. Something
went wrong with his highly trained reasoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
faculties; in short, these faculties ceased to function.
He sprang to his feet, wholly forgetful of his spectacles,
and leaped upon Deputy Jenney, uttering a
cry of rage. Now Evan had not the least idea what
was needful to be done by a man who went into
battle; he lost sight of the fact that a man of his
stature could not reasonably expect to make satisfactory
progress in tearing apart a man of Jenney’s
proportions. Of one thing alone he was conscious,
and that was a desire to strew the deputy about the
road in fragments.</p>

<p>Some one who saw the fracas described it later,
and his phrase is worth retaining. “The professor,”
said this historian, “jest kind of b’iled up over
Jenney.”</p>

<p>That is what Evan did. He boiled up over the
big man, inchoate, bubbling arms and legs, striking,
kicking. Deputy Jenney was surprised, but delighted.
He pushed Evan off with a huge hand and
flailed him a second time under the ear. Evan repeated
his previous gymnastics. This time he picked
himself up more quickly. His head was clear now.
The wild rage which had possessed him was gone.
But there remained something he had never experienced
before—a cold intent to kill!</p>

<p>He sprang upon the deputy again, not blindly this
time, but with such effect as a wholly inexperienced
man could muster. He even succeeded in striking
Jenney before he was sent whirling to a distance
again.... Now, your ordinary citizen would have
known it was high time to bring the matter to a discreet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
conclusion, but Evan came to no such realization.
He knew only one thing, that he must somehow
batter and trample this huge animal until he
begged for mercy....</p>

<p>At this instant Carmel Lee issued from the office,
and stood petrified as she saw the deputy knock
Evan down for the third time, and then, instead of
screaming or running for help or of doing any of
those things which one would have expected of a
woman, she remained fascinated, watching the brutal
spectacle. She was not indifferent to its brutality,
not willing Evan should be beaten to a pulp, but
nevertheless she stood, and nothing could have
dragged her away. It was Evan who fascinated her—something
about the professor gripped and held
her breathless.</p>

<p>She saw him get slowly to his feet, brush his
trousers, blink calmly at the deputy as at some rather
surprising phenomenon, and then, with the air of a
man studiously intent upon some scientific process,
spring upon the big man for the third time. Carmel
could see the professor was not in a rage; she could
see he was not frightened; she could see he was
moved by cold, grim intention alone.... The
deputy was unused to such proceedings. Generally
when he knocked a man down that man laid quietly
on his back and begged for mercy. There was no
sign of begging for mercy in Evan Pell. Hitherto
Jenney had used the flat of his hand as being, in his
judgment, a sufficient weapon for the destruction of
Evan Pell. Now, for the first time, he used his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
fist. The professor swarmed upon him so like a
wildcat that Jenney was unable to deliver the sort
of blow on the exact spot intended. The blow
glanced off Evan’s skull and the young man seized
Jenney’s throat with both hands. Jenney tore him
loose and hurled him away. Again Pell came at
him, this time to be knocked flat and bleeding. He
arose slowly, swaying on his feet, to rush again.
Carmel stood with gripped fists, scarcely breathing,
unable to move or to speak. The sight was not pleasant.
Again and again the big man knocked down
the little man, but on each occasion the little man,
more and more slowly, more and more blindly, got
to his feet and fell upon his antagonist. He was all
but blind; his legs wabbled under him, he staggered,
but always he returned to his objective. That he
was not rendered unconscious was amazing. He
uttered no sound. His battered lips were parted and
his clean, white, even teeth showed through....
The deputy was beginning to feel nonplused....
He knocked Evan down again. For an instant the
young man lay still upon his back. Presently he
moved, rolled upon his face, struggled to his hands
and knees, and, by the power of his will, compelled
himself to stand erect. He wavered. Then he took
a tottering step forward and another, always toward
Jenney. His head rolled, but he came on. Jenney
watched him vindictively, his hands at his sides.
Pell came closer, lifted his right fist as if its weight
were more than his muscles could lift, and pushed
it into the deputy’s face. It was not a blow, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
there was the intention of a blow, unquenchable intention....
The deputy stepped back and struck
again. No more was necessary. Evan Pell could
not rise, though after a few seconds he tried to do
so. But even then the intention which resided in
him was unquenched.... On hands and knees he
crawled back toward Deputy Jenney—crawled, struggled
to his enemy—only to sink upon his face at the
big man’s feet, motionless, powerless, unconscious.</p>

<p>Jenney pushed him with his foot. “There,” he
said, a trifle uncertainly, “I guess that’ll do fer you....
And that’s what you git every time we meet.
Remember that. Every time we meet.”</p>

<p>Carmel seemed to be released now from the enchantment
which had held her motionless. She had
seen a thing, a thing she could never forget. She
had seen a thing called physical courage, and a higher
thing called moral courage. That is what had held
her, fascinated her.... It had been grim, terrible,
but wonderful. Every time she saw Evan return
to his futile attack she knew she was seeing the
functioning of a thing wholly admirable.</p>

<p>“I never see sich grit,” she heard a bystander say,
and with the dictum she agreed. It had been pure
grit, the possession of the quality of indomitability....
And this was the man she had looked down
upon, patronized!... This possession had been
hidden within him, and even he had not dreamed of
its presence. She caught her breath....</p>

<p>In an instant she was bending over Evan, lifting
his head, wiping his lips with her handkerchief. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
looked up in Deputy Jenney’s eyes, and her own eyes
blazed.</p>

<p>“You coward!... You unspeakable coward!”
she said.</p>

<p>The deputy shuffled on his feet. “He got what was
comin’ to him.... He’ll git it ag’in every time I
see him. I’ll drive him out of this here town.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Carmel—and she knew she was speaking
the truth—“you won’t drive him out of town.
You can kill him, but you can’t drive him out of
town.”</p>

<p>The deputy shrugged his shoulders and slouched
away. He was glad to go away. Something had
deprived him of the enjoyment he anticipated from
this event. He had a strange feeling that he had
not come off victor in spite of the fact that his antagonist
lay motionless at his feet.... Scowls and
mutterings followed him, but no man dared lift his
hand.</p>

<p>Evan struggled to lift his head. Through battered
eyes he looked at the crowd packed close about him.</p>

<p>“Er—tell this crowd to disperse,” he said.</p>

<p>“Can you walk?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said in his old, dry tone—somewhat
shaky, but recognizable.</p>

<p>“Let me help you into the office.”</p>

<p>He would have none of it. “I fancy I can walk
without assistance,” he said, and, declining her touch,
he made his way through the crowd and into the
office, where he sunk into a chair. Here he remained
erect, though Carmel could see it was nothing but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
his will which prevented him from allowing his head
to sink upon the table. She touched his arm.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she said. “I—I want to apologize
for—for things I have said to you.”</p>

<p>He looked at her in his old manner, rather superciliously.
“Oh, doubtless you were right,” he said.
“I—er—do not seem to be a success as a—pugilist.”</p>

<p>“You were——”</p>

<p>“If you please,” he said, holding up a hand which
he strove to keep from shaking. “If you will be
so good as to go to luncheon.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“If you get pleasure out of seeing me like this!”
he said with acerbity, and she, seeing how his pride
was wounded, how he was shaken by this new experience,
and understanding very vaguely something
of the emotions which must be seething within him,
turned away and left him alone....</p>

<p>When Carmel returned to the office Evan Pell was
not there, nor did she see him until the following day.</p>

<p>That evening, after her supper, she walked. She
could not remain in her room to read, nor go to the
office to work. She was lonesome, discouraged,
frightened. The events of the day had upset her
until she seethed.... Motion was necessary. Only
in rapid exercise could she find the anodyne necessary
to quiet the jangling of her nerves. The evening
was fine, lighted by a summer moon which
touched the mountains with magic and transformed
the forest into a glowing mystery of silver. She did
not walk to think, but as the distance unrolled between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
her feet and the disturbed nerves became
quiescent, she did think.</p>

<p>For the first time she considered Evan Bartholomew
Pell as a human being. Never before had he
been human to her, but a crackling, parchment creature,
not subject to joys and sorrows, not adaptable
to friendships and social relations. She had pictured
him carelessly as an entity to himself, unrelated to
the world which moved about him, and loved and
hated and coveted and covered itself with a mantle
of charity. He had aroused her sympathy by his
helplessness and his incapacity—a rather contemptuous
sympathy.... Her contempt was gone, never
to return. She speculated upon the possible workings
of his mind; what was to become of him; why
he was as he was. He became a human possibility
in her mind, capable of <i>something</i>. She saw how
there resided in him, in spite of his wasted years,
in spite of the incubus of precocity which had ridden
him from childhood, the spirit of which men are
created.... She wondered if he were capable of
breaking through the crust and of emerging such a
man as the world might admire.... She doubted
it. The crust was so thick and so hard.</p>

<p>Of one thing she was certain—never again could
she sneer at him or treat him with supercilious superiority,
for, whatever his patent defects, she had been
compelled to recognize that the foundations of him
were admirable.... She vowed, in her impulsive
way, to make amends. She went even farther, as
is the way with girls both impulsive and calculating—she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
determined to remake Evan Pell, to remodel
him along lines of her own designing.... Women
love to renovate men; it is, perhaps, the major side
line to the primary business of their lives—and God
knows what that may be!</p>

<p>Carmel paid scant attention to the road she followed.
It was a pleasant road, a silvery-bright road.
It contented her and seemed a road which must lead
to some desirable destination. The destination was
vague and distant; she did not hope to reach it, but
it amused and stirred her to think there must be such
a terminal.</p>

<p>She walked away from Gibeon for an hour before
she realized that every step she took meant two steps,
one coming and one returning. She was unconscious
of loneliness, nor did she feel any apprehension of
the silent woods. The spot where she paused was
lovely with cold light and warm shadows and she
looked about for a place to sit and rest a moment
before her return journey. She stepped from the
roadside and seated herself upon a fallen, rotting log,
partially screened from the thoroughfare by clump
growth of young spruce.</p>

<p>Hardly had she taken her seat when a small automobile
roared around a bend and jounced and rattled
toward Gibeon. It was going at high speed. On the
front seat she saw two male figures, but so uncertain
was the light and so rapid the passage that she was unable
to identify them. She started to her feet to stare
after the car, when, to her amazement, it came to a
skidding stop, with screaming of brakes, a scant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
hundred yards beyond her. It maneuvered a moment,
and then, departing from the road, groaning
through the dry ditch that bordered it, the car forced
its way into the woods where there was no road
at all.</p>

<p>Carmel was intrigued by this eccentric behavior.
Automobiles, as she knew them, did not habitually
leave excellent roads to roam about in a trackless
forest. The cars she knew were creatures of habit,
adhering to the beaten paths of hurrying civilization.
She could not imagine one adventuring on its own,
and most especially she could not conceive of one
rambling about in the woods. She had a feeling
that it was not right for one to do so—which was
natural to her as a human being, for all human beings
have a firm belief that anything not sanctioned by
immemorial custom must be evil. New paths lead
inevitably to damnation.</p>

<p>She was startled, but not frightened. Whatever
was going on here could not threaten her, for she
knew herself to have been unseen; appreciated how
easy it would be to remain in concealment.</p>

<p>Presently she heard the sound of axes.... She
crouched and waited—possibly for fifteen minutes.
At the end of that time the car pushed its rump
awkwardly out of the woods again, swung on to the
road, and, stirring a sudden cloud of dust, sped
toward Gibeon.... It was only then she realized
the car had been traveling without lights.</p>

<p>She waited. The sound of the automobile vanished
in the distance and she judged it safe to investigate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Somewhat gingerly she emerged upon the
road and walked toward the spot where the car had
entered the woods. The wheel tracks were plainly
to be seen, and she followed them inward. It was
but a step, perhaps fifty yards. At the end there was
nothing but a pile of freshly cut sprucelings. Had
the season been other than summer, she would have
concluded some one was cutting Christmas trees for
the market—but one did not cut Christmas trees in
July! But why were the little spruces cut? There
must be a reason. She stirred them with her foot.
Then, with impulsive resolution, she began flinging
them aside.</p>

<p>Underneath she came upon a square of canvas—a
cover—and concealed by this the last thing in the
world she would have expected to come upon....
Bottles and bottles and bottles, carefully laid and
piled. Instantly she knew, even before she lifted a
bottle and read the label which identified it as whisky
of foreign distillage, she had witnessed one step in a
whisky smuggler’s progress; had surprised a <i>cache</i>
of liquor which had evaded the inspectors at the
border, a few miles away. She did not count the
bottles, but she estimated their number—upward of
a hundred!</p>

<p>She was frightened. How it came about, by what
process of mental cross-reference, she could not
have said, but the one thing obtruding upon her consciousness
was the story of the disappearance of
Sheriff Churchill! Had he come upon such a hoard?
Had his discovery become known to the malefactors?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Did that, perhaps, explain his inexplicable
absence?</p>

<p>Carmel’s impulse was to run, to absent herself
from that spot with all possible celerity. She started,
halted, returned. There could be no danger now, she
argued with herself, and there might be some clew,
something indicative of the identity of the men she
saw in the car. If there were, it was her duty as
proprietor of the <i>Free Press</i> to come into possession
of that information.</p>

<p>Fortune was with her. In the interstices of the
bottles her groping hand came upon something small
and hard. She held it in the moonlight. It was a
match box made from a brass shotgun shell....
Without pausing to examine it, she slipped it securely
into her waist, then—and her reason for
doing so was not plain to her—she helped herself
to a bottle of liquor, wrapped it in the light sweater
she carried, and turned her face toward Gibeon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARMEL went directly to the room in the hotel
which she still occupied pending the discovery
of a permanent boarding place. She locked the door
carefully and closed the transom. Then with a queer
feeling of mingled curiosity and the exultation of a
newspaper woman, she placed side by side on her
dresser the bottle of liquor she had abstracted from
the <i>cache</i> and the match box made from a brass shotgun
shell.</p>

<p>She sat down on the bed to regard them and to ask
them questions, but found them singularly uncommunicative.
Beyond the meagerest replies she could
have nothing of them. The bottle seemed sullen,
dour, as became a bottle of Scotch whisky. In the
most ungracious manner it told Carmel its name and
the name of its distillers and its age.... The match
box refused to make any answers whatever, being,
she judged, of New England descent, and therefore
more closed mouth than even the Scotch. The bottle
squatted and glowered dully. It wore an air of
apprehension, and patently was on its guard. The
brass match box, brought to a fine polish by long
travel in an active trousers pocket, was more jaunty
about it, having a dry, New England humor of its
own, recognizable as such. The identifying quality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
of New England humor is that you are always a
little in doubt as to whether it is intended to be humor.</p>

<p>The conversation was one-sided and not illuminating.</p>

<p>“Who brought you over the line?” Carmel asked.</p>

<p>The bottle hunched its shoulders and said nothing,
but the match box answered in the dialect of the
country, “I fetched him—for comp’ny. A feller gits
dry sleepin’ out in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Who made you, anyhow?” Carmel asked of the
match box.</p>

<p>“Feller that likes to keep his matches dry.”</p>

<p>“Somebody who likes to hunt,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, him ’n me knows our way about in the
woods.”</p>

<p>“Who was coming to get you from where you were
hidden?” Carmel asked the bottle, suddenly.</p>

<p>“D’ye ken,” said the bottle, sourly, “I’m thinkin’
ye are an inqu<i>ee</i>sitive body. Will ye no gang aboot
your business, lassie. Hae doon wi’ ye; ye’ll hae
no information frae me.”</p>

<p>“Who were those two men in the car?” said
Carmel.</p>

<p>“Strangers to me,” said the match box, nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“One of them dropped you,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Mebby he did; dunno <i>if</i> he did,” said the match
box.</p>

<p>“Somebody’ll know who owns you,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“How’ll you go about finding that out?” said the
match box. “Findin’ <i>caches</i> of licker in the woods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
hain’t good fer the health, seems as though. Traipsin’
around town askin’ who owns me might fetch
on a run of sickness.”</p>

<p>“You can’t frighten me,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Sheriff Churchill wa’n’t the frightenin’ kind,
neither,” said the match box, significantly.</p>

<p>“What if I put a piece in my paper telling just
how I found you?” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Be mighty helpful to our side,” said the match
box. “Stir up ill feelin’ without gittin’ you any
place.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do, then?” Carmel asked.</p>

<p>“Can’t expect <i>me</i> to be givin’ you advice,” said
the match box. And there the conversation lapsed.
The bottle continued to glower and the match box
to glitter with a dry sort of light, while Carmel regarded
them silently, her exasperation mounting.
She was in the unenviable position of a person to
whom belongs the next move, when there seems no
place to move to.</p>

<p>In the mass of uncertainty there was, as metallurgists
say, of fact only a trace. But the trace of
fact was important—important because it was the
first tangible evidence coming into her possession of
what was going on under the surface of Gibeon.
She had promised herself to bring to retribution those
who had caused the disappearance of Sheriff Churchill.
She felt certain it was the possession of some
such evidence as stood before her on her dresser,
which lay at the root of the sheriff’s vanishing. The
thought was not comforting. Of another thing she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
felt certain, namely, that the <i>cache</i> she had discovered
was no sporadic bit of liquor smuggling, but was a
single manifestation of a systematic traffic in the
contraband. She calculated the number of the bottles
she had seen and the profits derived from that
single store of whisky. It amounted to four figures.
Supposing that amount were carried across the border
weekly!... Here was no little man’s enterprise.
Here were returns so great as to indicate the participation
of an individual of more than ordinary
stature. Also it suggested to her that such individual
or group would not tolerate interference with this
broad river of dollars.... The fate of Sheriff
Churchill corroborated this reflection.</p>

<p>The bottle and match box on her dresser were
dangerous. They stood as if they realized how
dangerous they were, and leered at her. She arose
quickly and placed them in a lower drawer, covering
them carefully with garments. The woman in her
wished she had not made the discovery, and by it
confronted herself with the responsibility for taking
action. The newspaper proprietor exulted and
planned how the most was to be derived from it.
For the first time she felt self-distrust and wished
for a sure counselor. She realized her aloneness.
There was none to whom she could turn for sure
advice; none to whom her confidence moved her.</p>

<p>Her friends were few. In Gibeon she was confident
of the loyalty of Tubal and of Simmy, the
printer’s devil. They would fight for her, follow
her lead to the ultimate—but neither was such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
she could appeal to for guidance. Evan Bartholomew
Pell owed her gratitude. Doubtless he felt
some rudiments of it and possibly of loyalty. She
was dubious of both. He was such a crackling, dry,
self-centered creature—not contemptible as she had
first seen him. Never again could she visualize him
as contemptible. But to go to him for advice in this
emergency seemed futile. He would guide her by
rule and diagram. He would be pedantic and draw
upon printed systems of logic. What she wanted
was not cold logic out of a book, but warm, throbbing,
inspiring co-operation from out the heart. She
glanced at her watch. It told her the hour was verging
toward ten.</p>

<p>She sat upon the edge of her bed, debating the
matter in hand, when there sounded a knocking upon
her door.</p>

<p>“What is it,” she called.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fownes is down in the parlor a-waitin’. He
wants to know if you’ll come down and see him—if
you hain’t to bed yit.” The last sentence was obviously
not a part of the message, but interested conjecture
on the part of the messenger.</p>

<p>“What does he want?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t say. I asked him, but he let on ’twan’t none
of my business. Said it was important, though.”</p>

<p>Carmel pondered a moment. Aversion to the fat
little man waged war with woman’s curiosity to
know what his errand could be at this hour when
Gibeon was tucking itself into its feather beds.</p>

<p>“Please tell him I’ll come down,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>She went down. The parlor of the hotel was
tucked off behind the big room which was combined
office and lounging room for traveling men and village
loafers. It contained a piano which had not
been played since it had been tuned and had not been
tuned for a time so long that the memory of man
runneth not to the contrary. On the wall was a
hand painting of a forest fire, done by a talented
relative of the hotel’s proprietor. Doubtless this
portrayed some very special kind of forest fire, or
it would not have called forth the artist’s genius.
One would not know at first glance that it depicted
a forest fire, because it looked to the uninitiated like
a number of dilapidated red feather dusters standing
upright in a heavy surf. But it had been done by
hand, and Gibeon regarded it as her artistic farthest
north. There were also two gilt chairs, evidently
peeling after sunburn, a small onyx table and a
piece of furniture known to furniture manufacturers
of its period as a settee.... Abner Fownes was,
on Carmel’s entrance, the settor. He arose with the
ease and grace of a man lifting a barrel of flour
and bowed.</p>

<p>“You wished to see me?” she said, coldly.</p>

<p>“Very much. Very much indeed.”</p>

<p>“Your business would not wait until morning?”</p>

<p>“I chose this hour, Miss Lee,” he said, pompously.
“Dislike to be watched. Whole village watches me....
Doubtless very natural, but annoying.”</p>

<p>“I fancied we said all it was needful to say on
our last meeting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Time for reflection. Allowed you time to cool....
Hot youth. Er—must confess I admired your—er—force
of character.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m grateful.”</p>

<p>“Be seated. Can’t talk standing up,” he said, as a
potentate might invite some favored subject to be at
ease in his august presence. “Wish to discuss your
affairs.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Carmel, “with you.”</p>

<p>“Um!... How old would you say I am?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never given your age a thought.”</p>

<p>“Fifty-two,” he said, “and well preserved. Well
preserved. Careful living. Good habits.”</p>

<p>“It must be a satisfaction to you,” she said, with
ill-concealed irony.</p>

<p>“You have—er—style and beauty,” he said.
“Valuable attributes.... Be a credit to any man.”</p>

<p>“You came to talk business, did you not?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly.... Not precisely.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me why you have come,” she said,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Certainly. Arriving at the point.”</p>

<p>“Please do so. I am tired.”</p>

<p>He paused briefly while his small, sharp eyes
traveled over her person with an estimating glance,
a glance which heated her resentment. It was an
unpleasant glance for a young woman to undergo.</p>

<p>“Ahem!... Present your case. Inventory, so
to speak. You own a bankrupt country paper. Never
paid—never will. Alone in the world. No relatives.
Nobody to help you. No money. Hard future to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
face.... Debit side of the ledger. Um!...
Credit side shows youth—er—intelligence, education.
All valuable assets. Shows also beauty and—er—the
ability to look like a lady.... Breeding. Difficult
to find. Desirable.” He paused again until he
appraised her with greedy eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt apprehensive. A sense of outrage
swept over her, but for once words failed in
the emergency. She felt her limbs tremble. The
man’s eyes were an outrage; his manner was an
affront. She was angry as she had never been angry
before; terrified with a new sort of crawling, skin-chilling
terror. She was aware of being afraid he
might touch her; that his fat, pudgy, well-kept fingers
might reach out and rest upon her hand or her cheek
or her hair. If they should, she knew she would
scream. His touch would be intolerable. She had
a feeling it would leave a damp, ineradicable mark.
She drew back in her chair, crouching, quivering.</p>

<p>“Those assets,” he said, “entitle you to a future.
Should realize on them.... Ahem!...” Again
he paused and touched his cravat fussily. He glanced
down at his little shoes, immaculate, on his tailored
legs and impressive abdomen. “Beauty,” he said,
“requires ease and care.... Um!... Fades with
hard work and economy.”</p>

<p>He crossed his hands on his stomach and smiled
fatuously. “I,” he said, “have been a widower
fifteen years. A long time.... Not from necessity.
No, indeed. But my home, the sort of home
I maintain—in keeping with my position—er—requires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
an adequate mistress.... One possessing
qualities. Yes, indeed. Qualities suitable to the wife
of Abner Fownes.”</p>

<p>He drew himself up to the utmost of his scanty
height, making, as well, the most of his breadth.
He resembled, Carmel thought, a dropsical pouter
pigeon.</p>

<p>“The mistress of my home—er—mansion,” he
amended, “would occupy enviable position. Extremely.
Looked up to. Envied. Arbiter of local
society. Ease, comfort—luxury. Everything money
can buy.... Travel. Yes, indeed.... Clothes
suitable to her station and mine.... Women are
fond of clothes. Jewels. Amply able to provide
my wife with jewels.”</p>

<p>Carmel was breathless. Her heart beat in a manner
to cause her alarm lest it outdo itself. Her scalp
prickled. She wondered if something physically unpleasant
were going to happen—like fainting.</p>

<p>“Enviable picture,” he said, expansively. “Sufficient
to attract any woman. Be pointed out as Abner
Fownes’s wife. Women take pride in their husbands.
Husband of a personage.” At this he swelled to his
utmost.</p>

<p>“I have studied you,” he said, in a voice of one
coming to the end of an oration. “I have found you
in all ways capable of filling the position of my wife.
Er—you would be a credit to me. Yes, indeed.
End all your difficulties. Satisfy every whim. What
more can anybody ask?”</p>

<p>He stared at her pompously, but with a horrid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
hunger in his eyes, stared as if waiting for an
answer.</p>

<p>“I am asking you,” he said, “to become Mrs.
Abner Fownes.”</p>

<p>She gasped to hear the unthinkable put into words.
It had not seemed possible to her that it could be put
into words. It was the sort of thing one hinted at,
made use of <i>double entendre</i> to convey. But he
dragged it out into the light and gloated over it.
He insisted on stating it baldly.... She bore it as
she would endure some shock, quivered under the
affront of it, caught her breath, grasped at her heart
as if to quiet it with her fingers. For moments she
could not move nor speak. She was engulfed in
material horror of the thing. It was as if she were
immersed in some cold, clammy, clinging, <i>living</i> fluid—a
fluid endowed with gristly life.</p>

<p>Suddenly she found herself upon her feet, speaking
words. The words came from subconscious depths,
not directed by intellect or by will, but by the deep-lying
soul, by the living, indestructible thing which
was herself. Disgust emanated from her.</p>

<p>“You toad!” she heard herself say. “You white,
dreadful toad! You dare to say such words to <i>me</i>!
You dare to sit there appraising me, coveting me!
You ask me to be your wife—your <i>wife</i>!... You
are unspeakably horrible—can’t you see how horrible
you are?” She heard her voice arguing with him,
trying to impress him with his own horribleness.
“You dreadful, fat little creature! A credit to you!...
I can think of no woman so low, so degraded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
so unnatural as to be a credit to what you are. A
woman of the streets would refuse you. Your touch
would be death to her soul—to what fragment of
soul she retained.... How dare you insult me
so?...” The words would not stop, the dreadful
words. She did not wish to utter them, knew their
utterance served no purpose, but they continued to
flow as water from a broken spout. She rent and
tore him, holding him up to the light of the stars
for himself to see. It was a dreadful thing to do
to any human being; to sink one’s claws into his body,
searching for and finding and rending the soul.</p>

<p>She saw him turn the color of his vest; saw him
shrink, compress within himself, crumple, sag like a
punctured football. She saw an ugly glint in his
little, narrowed eyes; understood how she had put
upon him the supreme affront of stripping him of his
pretense and showing him to himself as he knew he
was. She stood him before his own eyes, stark,
horribly vivid; showed him secrets he concealed
even from himself. Yet it was not Carmel who did
this thing, but some uncontrollable force within her,
some force fighting the battle of womanhood....
He got unsteadily to his feet and backed away from
her mouthing. He stumbled, recovered, felt behind
him for the door.</p>

<p>“Damn you!” he cried shrilly. “Damn you!...
You—you’ll suffer for this....”</p>

<p>Then he was gone and she found herself kneeling
with her face upon the seat of her chair, shaken by
sobs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the morning Carmel Lee had made up her mind.
She did not know she had made up her mind, but
it was none the less true. Her mind was of the sort
which makes itself up upon slight provocation and
then permits its owner to reason and argue and apply
the pure light of reason to the problem in hand—a
sort of <i>ex post facto</i> deliberation. As may have been
noted, the salient characteristic of this young woman
was a certain impetuosity, a stubborn impulsiveness.
Once her mind made itself up to a certain course of
action, nothing short of an upheaval of nature could
turn her from it. But, notwithstanding, she considered
herself to be of a schooled deliberation. She
believed she had impressed this deliberation upon herself,
and was confident she reasoned out every matter
of importance gravely and logically.</p>

<p>Now, having determined just what she would do
about the <i>cache</i> of whisky she had discovered, she
sat down before her desk to determine what it was
best to do.</p>

<p>So enraged, so shaken, had she been by her
encounter with Abner Fownes the evening before,
that it was necessary for her to take action against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
somebody or something. She could not demolish
Fownes, and nobody else was handy, so she turned
to the whisky and vented her anger and disgust
upon that.</p>

<p>While she sat before her desk pretending to herself
that she was deliberating, Evan Bartholomew Pell
came into the office, nodded curtly, and dropped in
his chair. Carmel, of a sudden, seized paper and
commenced to write. As she set down word after
word, sentence after sentence, she became uneasily
aware of some distracting influence. Upon looking
up she identified this extraneous force as the eyes of
Evan Pell. He was staring at her fixedly.</p>

<p>“You forgot your spectacles this morning,” she
said, sharply, to cover her embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I have no spectacles,” he said, dryly.</p>

<p>“What became of them?”</p>

<p>“They—er—disappeared during the barbarous episode
of the other day.”</p>

<p>“You have no others?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“How can you work without them?”</p>

<p>“I find,” he said, “they are not essential. I was
about to discard them in any event.” He paused. “It
was clear to me,” he said, simply, “that a scholarly
appearance was not necessary to me in my new walk
of life.”</p>

<p>He said this so casually, with such good faith and
simplicity, that Carmel saw how little he realized the
absurdity of it. It demonstrated something of the
straightforwardness of the man, something simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
and childlike in him.... Carmel turned back
to her desk with a warmer feeling of friendship
toward Evan. There was something engaging, appealing
about the artificially dried, cloistered, egoistic
man.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” she said, presently, again aware
of his eyes, “you seem perfectly able to stare at me,
glasses or no glasses.”</p>

<p>“I was staring at you,” he admitted, with disconcerting
directness.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!... Why?”</p>

<p>“Because,” he said, “you present an interesting
problem.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!... What problem, if you please?”</p>

<p>There was no trace of self-consciousness in his
answer. It was direct, not made with humorous
intent, nor as a man of the world might have uttered
similar words. It issued from profound depths of
ignorance of life and of the customs and habits of
life.</p>

<p>“I find,” he said, “that I think about you a great
deal. Yes.... I find my thoughts taken up with
you at most inopportune moments. I am even able
to visualize you. Very queer. Only last evening,
when I should have been otherwise occupied, I suddenly
aroused myself to find I had been giving you
minute consideration for half an hour. I may even
say that I derived a certain pleasure from the exercise.
It was startling, if I may use so strong a word.
Doubtless there is some cause for such a mental
phenomenon.... Will you believe me, Miss Lee, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
was perfectly able to see you as if you were in the
room with me. I watched you move about. I could
see the changing expressions upon your face....
And when I realized how I was frittering away my
time, and set about resolutely to take up the business
in hand, I could do so only with the greatest difficulty.
Actually, I did so with regret, and thereafter
found concentration extremely difficult.... Therefore
I have been sitting here, studying you with the
utmost care to discover, if I can, the reason for these
things.”</p>

<p>“And have you discovered it?” Carmel asked, a
trifle breathlessly.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Undoubtedly you are pleasing
to the eye,” he said, “but I must have encountered
other people who are equally pleasing. I must confess
to being at a loss for an answer.”</p>

<p>Carmel experienced a wave of sympathy. She
hoped he would never discover the cause of the phenomenon,
and fancied it quite likely he would never
comprehend it. Mingled with her sympathy was a
sense of guilt. She reviewed her conduct toward
Evan Pell and could discover no action on her part
which justified a feeling of guilt, yet it persisted.
This queer, pedantic, crackling man was attracted to
her, was, perhaps, on the verge of falling in love with
her.... He was coming to life! She paused to
wonder what sort of man he would be if he really
came to life; if he sloughed off his shell of pedantry
and stood disclosed without disguise. Perhaps it
would be good for him to fall in love, no matter how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
vainly. It might be unpleasant for both of them,
but, she determined, if he did find out what ailed
him, she would be patient and gentle with him and
see to it the hurt she would inflict should be as slight
as she could make it.... It is to be noted her mind
was already made up. Evan had no chance whatever.
Already she had refused him, kindly, gently,
but firmly.... It was upsetting.</p>

<p>“Probably,” she said, with an artificial laugh, “it
is something you have eaten.”</p>

<p>“I have made no alteration in my diet,” he said,
and then, with the air of one who wrenches himself
away from an engrossing subject, “There seems to
be an unusual supply of liquor in Gibeon to-day.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ve noted a dozen men on the street this morning
who are indicative of the fact.”</p>

<p>“Where do they get it?”</p>

<p>As she turned to ask the question, she saw his
face change, saw a glint of determination in his really
fine eyes; saw his chin jut forward and the muscles
just under his jaw bunch into little white knots. “I
don’t know,” he said, “but I’m going to find out.”</p>

<p>Here was a new man, a man she had not seen.
This new man was as revealing as that indomitable
man she had seen fighting a futile fight with Deputy
Jenney.</p>

<p>“If I can find out who dispenses liquor in town,”
he said, “that will be a step toward discovering where
the dispensers get it. It will be climbing the first
round of the ladder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>For an instant she was about to tell him what she
had discovered, but it was vanity which stopped her.
It was her discovery, her “beat,” and she wanted to
surprise everybody with it.</p>

<p>“Whose business is it to stop this liquor traffic?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“First, it is the business of the law-enforcement
officials of this county—the sheriff and his subordinates.
This is a prohibition state and has been
for years. Second, it is the business of Federal enforcement
officials.”</p>

<p>“Who, doubtless, are few and far between in this
region.”</p>

<p>“Yes. To put a stop to the thing by legal means,
we must have the co-operation of the sheriff.”</p>

<p>“And there is no sheriff,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Er—removed by the liquor interests for cause,”
said Evan, dryly. “If I am a judge of appearances,
the sheriff’s office as it is now constituted is not
likely to give the rum smugglers a maximum of
uneasiness.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pell, when there is a vacancy in the office
of sheriff, how can that vacancy be filled?”</p>

<p>“I was reading the Compiled Statutes of the state
last night with that point in mind.... The Governor
may appoint a successor to fill the unexpired
term of office.”</p>

<p>Carmel turned back to her work, but once more
faced Evan abruptly. “Have you noticed an unusual
number of men going up to Lancelot Bangs’s
photograph gallery to-day?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“No. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. “I wondered.”</p>

<p>He eyed her a moment, then shrugged his shoulders.
“I shall give Mr. Bangs my attention,” he
said, and arose to leave the office.</p>

<p>Carmel arose, too, impulsively. “Please be cautious,
be careful.... I could never forgive myself
if anything happened to you.”</p>

<p>For an instant his eyes glowed, color mounted to
his cheeks. Then a look of astonishment, of sudden
apprehension, and of confusion succeeded it. He
turned and fled abruptly.</p>

<p>For an hour Carmel continued to write. She completed
a circumstantial account of the finding of the
liquor <i>cache</i>, omitting only the picking up of the
brass match box. It was intuition rather than judgment
which caused this omission. Having completed
this news story, she composed a three-quarter-column
editorial upon the subject, and therein she
walked a more dangerous path than in the mere recounting
of the news itself. She ventured into realms
of conjecture.</p>

<p>First she touched the traffic itself, then upon the
apparent magnitude of the industry locally, and then,
which was an unsafe thing to do, and unwise, she
pointed out with logic that such a huge business required
capital, organization, and intelligence. She
gave it as the opinion of the <i>Free Press</i> that here was
no affair of a few small bad men, but a real conspiracy
to break the laws of the land, to the end of a
huge profit. She named no names, because here conjecture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
was forced to pause, but she set afloat upon
the current of gossip a raft of suspicion. Who in
Gibeon was engaged in this conspiracy? Who was
at the head of it?... At the end she asked one
sentence:</p>

<p>“Find the men who hid this store of whisky in the
woods and you will have the murderers of Sheriff
Churchill.”</p>

<p>It was the first time a name had been given the
disappearance of the sheriff; the first time in print
that the word <i>murder</i> had been attached to it.</p>

<p>Carmel was well satisfied with herself. She took
the story and the editorial to Tubal, with directions
to set at once.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he appeared in the door, the
manuscript in his left hand, while with his right he
transferred ink from his fingers to his face.</p>

<p>“Lady,” he said, “be you serious about printin’
this here?”</p>

<p>“I certainly am.”</p>

<p>“All of it?”</p>

<p>“Every word, sentence, paragraph, and punctuation
mark.”</p>

<p>“My Gawd!... Say, Lady, now lookit here!
This here thing is loaded with dynamite, nitroglycerin,
TNT, and mustard gas. The dum thing’s
apt to go off right on the printin’ press and blow the
whole shebang to smithereens. If I was to drop a
page onto the floor—<i>whoof!</i>... Better think it
over.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought it over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Um!... It’s funny what folks calls thinkin’
sometimes! Hain’t despondent, be ye?”</p>

<p>“No. Why?”</p>

<p>“’Cause, if ye be, and kind of want to shuffle
off’n this mortal coil, you kin pick out easier ’n’
pleasanter ways of doin’ it. There’s layin’ down
with your head on the railroad track, f’r instance.”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid, Tubal?”</p>

<p>“Bet your life,” said Tubal, unabashed. “Can’t
say I git so much joy out of life that it makes me
go around hollerin’ and singin’, but what there is of
it I kind of like. When you’re dead you can’t chaw
tobacker. Ruther chaw than twiddle a harp. Uh
huh. Hain’t no printer’s ink to smell in heaven.”</p>

<p>“But maybe you won’t go to heaven, Tubal.”</p>

<p>“Bound to,” he said, gravely. “Got it all figgered
out. Says suthin’ in the Bible about the Lord ’u’d
rather herd in one sinner to heaven than ninety-nine
righteous fellers, don’t it? Wa-al, I’m the sinner
he was calc’latin’ on. When he goes to herd me in,
I hain’t goin’ to put up no resistance whatever.
Yas ’m I’m safe to pass them pearly gates on the
run.”</p>

<p>“Tubal, do you ever drink?”</p>

<p>“Frequent—but not too frequent.”</p>

<p>“Where do you get it?”</p>

<p>“Um!... Now there’s a question, Lady. Now
hain’t it? Want a feller to do me a favor like gittin’
liquor fer me in a dry and thirsty land, and then fer
me to go ’n’ tattle on him? Uh-uh, Lady. Can’t
be did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“But you’re loyal to me, aren’t you, Tubal?”</p>

<p>“Lady, seems like I’d come clost to lettin’ wild
hosses tromple onto me fer you.”</p>

<p>“Then why not help me when I’m trying to find
out about this liquor business?”</p>

<p>“Best help I kin give ye is to warn you to leave it
alone. Churchill, he meddled with it.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out who killed him.”</p>

<p>“Lady, you’re runnin’ up a tree that’s bound to be
struck by lightnin’.... Listen, there’s jest you ’n’
Simmy ’n’ that perfessor feller. Count us up—four.
What chanct we got?”</p>

<p>“Against whom, Tubal?”</p>

<p>“The ones we hain’t got no chanct ag’in’,” he
said noncommittally. “I dunno, Lady, and if I
knowed I wouldn’t tell. Men that hain’t afraid to
do away with a sheriff wouldn’t come to a sweat over
disposin’ of a printer like me.”</p>

<p>“It’s the business of a newspaper——”</p>

<p>“To make a livin’ for the owners of it and to keep
out of libel suits. Stick to that, Lady. Hain’t this
sheet in a bad enough way without your tyin’ a rock
to it and throwin’ it in the river?”</p>

<p>“We’re wasting time,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“You’re bound and determined to print this here?”</p>

<p>“I’ll print that if it’s the last act of my life.”</p>

<p>“Wa-al, if that’s the way you feel.... Mebby
it will be, mebby not, seems as though.” He walked
to the door, and there turned. “I own a book of
synonyms,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tubal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Goin’ to throw it away?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t correct.”</p>

<p>“How is it wrong?”</p>

<p>“Don’t give <i>woman</i> as a synonym for <i>lunatic</i>,” he
said, and disappeared abruptly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DEPUTY JENNEY, with a crumpled copy of
the <i>Free Press</i> in his hand, rushed into Abner
Fownes’s office—for once omitting the formality of
rapping on the door. He threw the paper upon the
desk and stood huge, bristling, speechless.</p>

<p>“What’s this?... What’s this?” Abner demanded,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Read it. Read it and see.... Hell’s busted
loose in the henhouse.”</p>

<p>Abner smoothed out the paper and read. His face
did not change, but his little eyes glowed dully, with
a light not pleasant to see, one that suggested pent-up
heat, a compression of scorching, searing forces capable
of awful explosion. He read the story of the
finding of the whisky <i>cache</i> from beginning to end;
then reread it, missing no word, no suggestion.
Jenney directed him to the editorial page with its
conjectures and comment. For some moments he
did not speak, but stared at his desk top with those
dull-glowing eyes until one might have expected
to see wisps of smoke arising from the spot they
touched.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the thoughts of Abner Fownes
were not upon the words he had read in the newspaper,
but on the writer of them. He was thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
of her apart from this journalistic bomb which she
had set off under the feet of Gibeon. Presently he
would give that his consideration, but now Carmel
Lee stood in the midst of his thoughts, and he reached
out to engulf her in his hatred. He hated her with
a burning, aching, hungry intensity—with the hatred
of a vain man who has been humiliated and stripped
stark of his vanity. The very words she had used,
but, more than those, the expression of her eyes,
was with him now. He watched her and listened
to her again, and felt himself shrinking and deflating
before her anger.... She despised him—him, Abner
Fownes! Despised him! And he hated her for
despising him. He hated her for stripping away so
ruthlessly the mantle of pretense he had erected between
himself and his own eyes. She had humiliated
him before his own soul, and his soul was sick with
the shame of it.</p>

<p>For years he had lived with his pretense until it
had become a part of himself, like the grafted branch
upon the sterile tree. None in Gibeon had gainsaid
his own estimate of himself. In his small realm he
had been supreme—until he had come himself to
believe his own pretense.... He hid Abner Fownes
from himself studiously; allowed him to admire himself,
to look upon himself as good and great....
In those wakeful moments of his soul when it opened
its eyes and saw him as he was, he suffered acutely—and
applied the ever-ready anesthetic.</p>

<p>Now this girl, to whom he had grandly thrown his
handkerchief like some Oriental potentate, had dared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
to snatch away his disguise and to destroy it utterly.
Never again could he wear it, because he would feel
her eyes piercing it. Such a garment is only to be
worn when there is none in all the world to recognize
that it is a disguise. Once a single soul lifts the mask
and gazes upon the reality lurking within, and the
thing is done. Abner Fownes knew Carmel saw
him as he was—not by sure knowledge, grounded
upon fact, perhaps, but by intuition. Now he would
forever question, and his question would be: Did
others see him as he was? Was the adulation showered
on him a pretense? Was the attitude people
maintained before him a sham, an ironical sham?
Was the world laughing at and despising him, as
Carmel Lee despised him?... It was unbearably
bitter to a man whose natural element was vanity;
who had existed in vanity, breathed it, fed upon it,
for a score of years.</p>

<p>It is no wonder he hated her!... He no longer
desired her. His one thought was to revenge himself
upon her, to humiliate her publicly as she had
humiliated him before his own eyes. He wanted to
degrade her, to besmirch her, to defile her so that
her soul would cry out with horror at sight of herself,
as his soul revolted at the thing she had conjured
up before his own eyes. His was not that
hatred which kills. It was more cruel than that, more
cowardly, more treacherous, more horrible. His was
the hatred which could satisfy itself only by setting
Carmel in the pillory; by damning her body and soul
and then by exhibiting her to a taunting world....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>He wrenched his eyes away from his desk, his
thoughts away from his hatred.</p>

<p>“What d’you mean by coming here with this, you
fool?” he demanded, savagely.</p>

<p>Deputy Jenney reared back on his heels from the
shock of it and goggled at Abner.</p>

<p>“Want to advertise to the world that I care a
damn what she prints about whisky? Want the
town to clack and question and wonder what I’ve
got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“I—I thought you’d want to know.”</p>

<p>“I’d find out soon enough.”</p>

<p>“What you aim to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Do.... Get on record as soon as I can. Congratulate
the <i>Free Press</i> on its courage and public
spirit.”</p>

<p>“But she’ll pull somethin’ down onto us—her and
that perfessor. Attractin’ notice to Gibeon. Fust
we know, we’ll be havin’ Federal officers here, and
then what?”</p>

<p>“We’ve fiddled long enough.... We’ll petition
the Governor to appoint a sheriff—before somebody
else gets his ear.”</p>

<p>“Me?” said Jenney.</p>

<p>“I guess folks’ll have to stomach you,” said Abner.</p>

<p>“But what about that danged paper? No tellin’
what she’ll hit on if she goes nosin’ around. Anyhow,
she’ll git folks all het up and excited.”</p>

<p>“Well, what would you do about it?” Abner
snapped.</p>

<p>“Me? I’d git me about a dozen fellers and fill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
’em with booze and give ’em sledge hammers. Then
I’d turn ’em loose on that printin’ office, and when
they got through there wouldn’t be enough left of
it to print a ticket to a church sociable with.”</p>

<p>“Um!...”</p>

<p>“That ’u’d settle <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’d lead them down yourself?”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>“I always thought you were a fool, Jenney. Why
not stand by the town jump and holler that you’re a
whisky runner?... And you planning to be sheriff....”
Abner waggled his head. “This is the kind
of brains I have to trust to,” he said, sourly.</p>

<p>“Hain’t nobody else to do it,” said Jenney, defensively.</p>

<p>“Seems like Peewee Bangs might be kind of irritated
by a newspaper piece like this—and you can
trust Peewee to keep in the background, too.”</p>

<p>Jenney slapped his leg, “And he’s got a bunch of
plug-uglies handy, too.”</p>

<p>Abner motioned to the door. “Get out,” he said,
“and don’t come near me again till I send for you.
I don’t want the smell of you on my clothes when I
walk down the street.”</p>

<p>Deputy Jenney walked down the road and presently
turned upon Main Street, which would carry
him past the <i>Free Press</i> office. He paused at sight
of a knot of people gathered before its window, and
joined them. Carmel had carried enterprise—or
indiscretion—to its ultimate. On a table in the
window stood a quart bottle of Scotch whisky. Behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
it stood a placard announcing it to be the evidence
in the case—a veritable bottle from the smuggler’s
<i>cache</i> in the woods. Jenney ground his teeth,
and, seeing Evan Bartholomew Pell seated at his
work, saw red for an instant. He was an impulsive
man, and temper often carried him somewhat beyond
the boundaries where good judgment reigned. It is
not easy to prophesy what he would have done had
not a hand rested on his arm.</p>

<p>“Whoo!... Easy there! So-ooo!” whispered
a voice, and, looking down, he saw the sharp, wolf-like
features of the hunchback, Peewee Bangs.</p>

<p>“Interestin’ exhibit,” said Bangs. “Kind of stole
a march on the sheriff’s office.” He laughed a thin,
shrill laugh.</p>

<p>“Come away from here. I got suthin’ to talk to
ye about,” said Jenney.</p>

<p>“That,” said Peewee, “makes two of us.”</p>

<p>“What’s <i>he</i> got to say about it?” Peewee asked
when they had turned the next corner and were in a
deserted side street.</p>

<p>“He don’t want it to happen ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Don’t wonder at it. Him ’n’ me agrees.”</p>

<p>“It hain’t goin’ to,” said Jenney, meaningly.</p>

<p>“So.... Now, f’r instance.... You listen,
Dep’ty, too many folks disappearin’ and onaccounted
for is goin’ to raise curiosity. Surer ’n’ shootin’....
More especial if it’s a woman.”</p>

<p>“No disappearin’s figgered on.... Anyhow, I’m
goin’ to be appointed sheriff by the Governor....
Naw. This here’s simple. Jest smashin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Like you done to the perfessor?... Gritty,
wa’n’t he? Never kin tell, kin ye?... I tell ye,
Jenney, that perfessor’s a feller to figger on.
Shouldn’t be s’prised if he got to be dangerous....
I wonder how come she to tie up to him.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t that kind of smashin’. <i>He</i> says fer you
to git a dozen fellers and fill ’em full, and then turn
’em loose on that printin’ shop with sledge hammers.
Kind of tinker with it, like. Git the idee?”</p>

<p>“So-oo!... Me, eh? I can’t see me leadin’ no
sich percession down Main Street. Hain’t achin’ to
git the public eye focused on me any. Talk enough
goin’ around now.”</p>

<p>“Fix it anyhow you like—only fix it.”</p>

<p>“What if the sheriff’s office is called to put down
the disturbance?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t git much result, seems as though,”
said the Deputy, humorously.</p>

<p>Peewee Bangs walked leisurely back to reconnoiter
the <i>Free Press</i> office, and, having satisfied himself,
clambered into his rickety car and drove out of
town in the general direction of the Lakeside Hotel.</p>

<p>Carmel Lee was seated at her desk, endeavoring
to appear oblivious to the excitement outside and to
the air of hostility within. Everybody disapproved.
Even Simmy, the printer’s devil, went about with a
look of apprehension, and stopped now and then to
peer at her reproachfully. Tubal blustered and muttered.
He had appeared that morning with an automatic
shotgun under his arm, which he stood against
the case from which he was sticking type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Going hunting?” Carmel asked, with pretended
innocence.</p>

<p>“Self-pertection,” said Tubal, “is the fust six laws
of nature, and the bulk of all the rest of ’em.”</p>

<p>“You’re trying to frighten me,” Carmel said, “and
you can’t do it. I won’t be frightened.”</p>

<p>“Different here. I <i>be</i> frightened.... Now go
back and write some more of them dynamite pieces,
Lady, and after the next issue of this here rag comes
out—if it ever does—I’m goin’ to throw up breast-works
and see if I can’t borrow me a machine
gun.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!” said Carmel.</p>

<p>Evan Pell did not refer to her work until she invited
his comment. Then he turned his eyes upon
her with something of the old superciliousness in
them and said, dryly, “What is done is done.”</p>

<p>“I gather you don’t approve.”</p>

<p>“I most certainly do <i>not</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why,” he countered, “did you not discuss this
step with me?”</p>

<p>“Why should I?” she answered, sharply.</p>

<p>“In order,” he said, “to receive an intelligent idea
of the course of action to take.” He said this with
flat finality, and turned his back. Thereafter Carmel
sulked.</p>

<p>She had expected some result—beneficial. Just
what result she had not envisaged. Perhaps she had
expected some public ovation, some sign that Gibeon
sided with her in her efforts to the end of law and
order. If she had hoped for this, she was disappointed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Gibeon buzzed with excitement, whispered
in corners, gathered in knots, but, such of its inhabitants
as found reason to address her, studiously
ignored the subject. Gibeon was manifestly uneasy.</p>

<p>If merely the selling of newspapers was her object,
she accomplished that. The edition was exhausted
before ten o’clock in the morning. No new flood of
advertising came to take advantage of the increase
in circulation.... She came to doubt her own judgment,
and to wonder if she had not acted again on
impulse. It was an unpleasant feeling—to know
that those upon whom she most relied regarded her
conduct with hostility.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was determined to persist. How,
with what material, she did not know. She grew
stubborn under opposition, and resolved that no issue
of the <i>Free Press</i> should appear in which the thing
should not be followed up.</p>

<p>Evan Pell got up from his place and went out without
a word. Presently she heard Tubal banging
about, preparatory to going home, and then she was
alone. She did not like the feeling of aloneness.
The thing had worn upon her more than she realized,
and her nerve ends jangled. She was conscious of a
rising discomfort of mind, which resolved itself into
apprehension as dusk fell and shadows filtered in to
flood the corners of the room with blackness. Her
mind persisted in thinking of Sheriff Churchill, of
the suddenness, the completeness of his disappearing.
He had stepped to his door—and from that instant
the world had lost him to sight. The mystery of it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the cruel efficiency of it, caused her to shudder. If
they—<i>they</i>—dared lay hands upon the chief official
of the county, what would cause them to hesitate to
deal with her in like manner?</p>

<p>She got up hastily, put away her work, and locked
the office. It was not until she was in the well-lighted
office of the hotel that a feeling of security came to
her again. Then she laughed at herself, but the
laughter was a pretense and she knew it to be pretense....
Suddenly she thought of Evan Pell.
What of him? If there were danger, was not his
danger greater than hers? Already he was the victim
of more than a threat.</p>

<p>Her appetite for supper was far from robust and
she was glad of the quiet and security of her room.
There she endeavored to read, and so passed away
the hours until her watch told her it was an hour
from midnight. She laid down her book, with a
mind to retiring, when there came a rush of footsteps
in the corridor without and a pounding upon
her door.</p>

<p>“Lady! Lady!... Lemme in! Lemme in, quick!...
It’s Simmy.”</p>

<p>She snatched open the door, and Simmy, face
splotched with ink as it had been hours before,
plunged into the room.</p>

<p>“They’re comin’!” he said, so excitedly he could
scarcely articulate. “They’re comin’ with sledge
hammers! Quick! They’re dum nigh there.”</p>

<p>She heard herself speak as though it were another
individual. As for herself, she was singularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
calm, even cool. It had come—the emergency. What
was it? What did it bring to her?</p>

<p>“Who is coming with sledge hammers?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Mebby a dozen of ’em—drunk and staggerin’.”</p>

<p>“What are they going to do?”</p>

<p>“Smash the office to smithereens. Bust the presses.
Knock everythin’ to pieces, so’s we can’t never print
no more.”</p>

<p>“How do you know? Who told you?”</p>

<p>“I was—hidin’ behind a fence.” He neglected to
state that it was for the purpose of feloniously obtaining
watermelons. “And I heard ’em talkin’.
Peewee Bangs was givin’ ’em licker and tellin’ ’em
what to do.... Oh, what be we goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>Carmel had no idea, except that she was going to
do something to avert this destruction which would
spell ruin to her and her paper. Not pausing for hat
or wrap, she tore open the door and rushed down the
stairs into the dark street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is much to be doubted if violence and scenes of
violence are as abhorrent to the so-called gentler
sex as it is popular to pretend. There lurks in a corner
of the mind an impish suggestion that a woman,
underneath a pretense of dismay or horror, enjoys
the spectacle of a fight as much as a man. This
polite supposition regarding women has barred them
from much pleasure in watching the antagonist sex
batter itself about. Next to dogs and line fences,
women have caused more fights than any other item
of creation—they should be permitted to enjoy the
fruits of their activities.... Women are more
quarrelsome than men. This is because they know
words will not merge into fists—or at worst into the
vicarious fists of husbands or brothers. It is not
unthinkable that the attribute of the ably acrimonious
tongue would atrophy and disappear from the feminine
part of the human race within a generation or
two if it were permitted to resolve into action rather
than barbed innuendo. A field for some rising
reformer!</p>

<p>Consequently Carmel was not shocked at being involved
in such proceedings. She was angry, apprehensive.
Her overshadowing sensation was one of
impotence. If men were coming to wreck her newspaper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
what could she do about it? It was humiliating
to be so ineffective in a crisis like this. A man,
<i>any</i> man, would be more efficient than she.</p>

<p>The streets were deserted. A quick glance showed
her the attacking force—if attacking force existed
save in Simmy’s dime-novel-tainted imagination—had
not yet made itself visible.... With the boy at
her heels she ran in most undignified manner to the
<i>Free Press’s</i> door, admitted herself quickly, and
lighted a light.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, breathlessly, “here we are,
Simmy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’m,” said Simmy with singular helpfulness.</p>

<p>“I shall call the police,” Carmel said, taking refuge
in that expedient of the law-abiding. She turned the
handle of the old-fashioned telephone with which
Gibeon is afflicted and gave the number of the Sheriff’s
office. A drowsy voice answered presently.</p>

<p>“This is the <i>Free Press</i>,” said Carmel. “Send
some deputies at once. Men are coming to wreck this
place with sledge hammers.”</p>

<p>“Aw, go on!” said the voice. “Ye can’t play no
jokes on me.”</p>

<p>“This is not a joke. It is Miss Lee speaking. I
want police protection.”</p>

<p>“Jest a minute,” said the voice, and then another,
heavier voice took its place.</p>

<p>“Dep’ty Jenney speakin’. What’s wanted?”</p>

<p>“This is Miss Lee. A crowd of drunken men are
coming to mob this office. Send men here instantly.”</p>

<p>“Um!... Somebody’s jokin’ ye, Miss Lee. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
here’s a peaceful, law-abidin’ community. Better go
back to bed and fergit it.”</p>

<p>“Will you send men here at once?”</p>

<p>“Now, ma’am, that hain’t possible. Can’t roust
men out of bed and send ’em traipsin’ all over jest
on account of a woman gittin’ upset. You go back
to bed. Nothin’ hain’t goin’ to happen. Nothin’ ever
does.” He hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>It was obvious. Carmel <i>knew</i>. There was collusion
between the sheriff’s office and whoever had set
a party of drunken irresponsibles upon her. No evidence
was needed to demonstrate this to her. It was,
and she stored the fact away in her mind vengefully.</p>

<p>“Where’s Tubal? Where’s Mr. Pell?” she asked
Simmy.</p>

<p>“Dunno. Hain’t seen nuther of ’em. Nobody
never sees nobody when they need them.... Oh,
what we goin’ to do? What we goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>He ran into the back room—the composing room—as
if he hoped to find some workable course of
action lying there ready to be picked up. He was
frightened. Carmel could not remember ever having
seen a boy quite so terrified. Perhaps the ink
blotches on his face made him seem paler than he
actually was! But he stayed. The way was open
for him to desert her, but the thought did not seem
to occur to him. Ignorant, not overly bright, there
nevertheless glowed in Simmy a spark of loyalty, and
Carmel perceived it and, even in that anxious moment,
treasured it.</p>

<p>Presently he came out of the press room, eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
gleaming with terror, shock head bristling, dragging
after him, by its barrel, Tubal’s automatic shotgun.</p>

<p>“By gum! The’ shan’t nobody tetch you, Lady,
’less ’n it’s over my dead body.” His voice quavered
as he spoke, but Carmel knew her one defender would
remain stanch so long as the breath of life remained
in him.</p>

<p>“Simmy,” she said, “come here.”</p>

<p>He came and stood beside her chair. His head
was scarcely higher than Carmel’s, seated in her
chair.</p>

<p>“Simmy,” she said, “you do like me, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” Simmy said, worship in his eyes and
voice.</p>

<p>She put her hands on his shoulders and kissed his
smudgy cheek. “There, I think you’d better run
along now, Simmy. They—they might hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I’m a-goin’ to stay right straight here,” he said.
“Oh, Lady! What’s that? Listen to that! They’re
a-comin’. Sure’s shootin’, they’re a-comin’.”</p>

<p>“Put out the lights,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>They stood in darkness. Carmel stretched out her
hand and took the shotgun from Simmy’s grip. The
feel of the cold barrel was distasteful to her. She
felt a sense of outrage that she should be compelled
to come in contact with an event such as this, an
event of sordidness and violence. This was a reaction.
For the moment she conceived of herself as
doing something which, in the words of her grandmother,
was unladylike. Even then she smiled at it.
This was succeeded by determination. Doubtless her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
great-grandmothers had defended their homes from
the raids of savage Indians. They had not been too
delicate to handle firearms in the defense of their
lives and their homes. Why should she be less resolute
than they.... There was the story of the great-great-aunt
who had killed an intruding savage with
an ax!... If those things were heroic in pioneer
days, why were they so unthinkable to-day? If
women could display resolution, high courage, and
perform awful acts of fortitude in 1771, why was
not the woman of 1921 capable of conduct as
praiseworthy?</p>

<p>Then, too, there was a specious unreality about the
affair, something of play-acting. Carmel could not
dispel the reflection that it was not <i>so</i>. She was
making believe. No drunken men were actually approaching
with sledge hammers. Her plant and
her person were in no danger. It was playing with
other toys substituted for dolls. She drew closer
to her the cold barrel of the toy she clutched in her
fingers.</p>

<p>“The safety’s on,” said Simmy, practically.</p>

<p>“The safety?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’m, so’s nobody kin shoot himself. You
have to take off the safety before the trigger’ll pull.”</p>

<p>“How do you do it?”</p>

<p>“You push this here dingus,” said Simmy.</p>

<p>Carmel promptly pushed it.</p>

<p>Far down the street she heard a single shout, a
few maudlin words of a lumber-camp song. She
stepped to the door and peered up the shadowy thoroughfare.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Across the Square and perhaps two blocks
away she made out a number of dark figures, straggling
toward her in midstreet. She could not count
accurately, but estimated there were ten or a dozen
of them. She crouched in the recess of the doorway
and waited. Unreality was dispelled now. She was
cognizant of fact—literal, visible, potent fact.</p>

<p>Her sensation was not fear, but it was unpleasant.
It resembled nothing in her experience so much as the
feeling one has in the pit of his stomach when descending
rapidly in an elevator. She could feel her
knees tremble. Always she had heard this spoken of
as a symbol of cowardice, and she tried to restrain
their shaking.... The men approached noisily.</p>

<p>“Light the lights,” she said to Simmy when the
men were some fifty yards distant. This was instinct—the
instinct for surprise. It was excellent strategy.
The men had their directions how to proceed,
but in these directions no account was taken of lights
turning on unexpectedly. They had been led to expect
a deserted office and no resistance. They stopped
abruptly and gathered in a knot to inquire the meaning
of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Carmel did some calculation for the first time.
To reach the office the men would have to cross the
area of light passing through its windows. She, herself,
was in the darkness beyond. This, she thought,
was as it should be.... Presently the men surged
forward again, keeping closely together. Carmel
stepped out of the shadows into the light, where she
and her weapon must be plainly visible, and paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Stop,” she called, sharply.</p>

<p>They stopped, then somebody laughed. The laugh
touched the fuse leading to the magazine of Carmel’s
anger. She blazed with the explosion of it. The
laugh was a slight thing, but it caused the difference
between a mere young woman holding a gun in her
hands, and a young woman holding a gun in her
hands which she would shoot. She stepped backward
into the shadows where she could not be
seen.</p>

<p>“Go away,” she said.</p>

<p>“Li’l’ girl with li’l’ shotgun,” somebody said, in a
tone of interest.</p>

<p>“I’m going to count ten,” said Carmel. “If you
haven’t gone then I’ll shoot.”</p>

<p>“Li’l’ girl kin count to ten,” said the same voice.
“Hain’t eddication hell!”</p>

<p>“One,” she began, “two, three, four——”</p>

<p>There was a forward movement, raucous laughter,
inebriated comments. She hastened her counting—“five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten....” They were
still moving forward slowly, evidently viewing the
situation as humorous. She lifted the heavy gun
and pointed its muzzle at the mass of approaching
legs.... Her acquaintance with twelve-gauge automatic
shotguns, and with the dispositions thereof,
was rudimentary. She did not know what to expect,
nevertheless she tugged at the trigger. There was
a tremendous report which frightened her as nothing
had frightened her that night. She felt as if
one of those men had thrown his sledge and struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
her shoulder. Dazed, bewildered, she all but lost
her balance.</p>

<p>But, steadying herself, keeping her finger on the
trigger, she maintained a readiness for what might
come next. Howls of agony emanated from the
men. Two of them were rolling on the sidewalk
clutching shins and cursing. But for this there was
silence. Humor had departed from the situation,
for even the smallest bird shot, discharged from a
shotgun at less than a hundred feet, are not to be
disregarded by those who shun pain.</p>

<p>“She’s shot my leg off.... My Gawd!...”</p>

<p>This exclamation of agony trailed off into curses
and incoherent ejaculations.</p>

<p>“Now go away,” Carmel called. “Next time I’ll
shoot higher.”</p>

<p>The shot, the suddenness, the unexpectedness of
it, had cleared tipsy brains. It had created angry,
dangerous men.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t nothin’ but bird shot. All rush her to
wunst,” shouted a voice. But before they could resolve
into action Carmel fired again, and then again....
It was rather more than such a collection of
humanity could endure. With shouts and cries of
pain they broke and ran. Carmel advanced, ready
for another discharge, when, suddenly, there was a
diversion. The attackers were taken in the rear, by
whom Carmel could not determine. She saw
at least two men, arms swinging clubs right and
left with rare indiscrimination. The retreat became
a rout. These unexpected reserve forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
definitely turned the tide of battle, and in a time
so brief as to make its recording difficult, the
street was again deserted save for Carmel—and the
reserves.</p>

<p>They ran to her, Tubal and Evan Bartholomew
Pell. It was the professor who reached her first,
and stood inarticulate, trembling, his face working.
His eyes searched her face and in them was such an
expression as she had never seen turned upon her by
human eyes before.... Nevertheless she recognized
it.</p>

<p>“Carmel,” he said—“Carmel—are you—all
right?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” she said, endeavoring to maintain an
attitude of aloofness toward the whole episode.</p>

<p>“If anything had happened to you—if one of
those beasts had touched you—even with the tip of
his finger....”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, stared at her. It was as if
his scholarly mind had once more come into its own,
had seen, classified, cross-referenced his actions and
sensations. His face mirrored astonishment, then
apprehension, embarrassment. It completed the
series by becoming that of a man utterly nonplused.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” he said, breathlessly, “I believe
I’ve fallen in love with you.”</p>

<p>She made no reply, such was her own astonishment
at the manner of this announcement. He glared
at her now, angry reproach in his eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s absurd,” he said. “You had no business
permitting me to do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>With that he turned on his heel and stalked into
the office. Carmel gasped....</p>

<p>“Lady,” said Tubal, “you better pass me that gun.
You ’n’ a shotgun fits each other about as suitable
as a plug hat.... If you was to ask me I’d say
right out in meetin’ that you ’n’ a gun is doggone
incongruous.”</p>

<p>“I shot it, anyhow,” she said.</p>

<p>“Dummed if you didn’t,” he exclaimed, admiringly.
“Dummed if you didn’t. Them fellers’ll be pickin’
bird shot out of the bosoms of their pants fer a month
to come.” Then he paused to give rhetorical effect
to the moral he was about to draw.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t went off half cocked with that
whisky piece of your’n,” he said, “this here ol’ gun
wouldn’t have had to go off at all.”</p>

<p>But she was not thinking of Tubal nor of pointed
morals. She was considering the case of Evan Bartholomew
Pell and what she would do with him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE days which succeeded that night’s adventure
were placid. Carmel awoke in the morning
as one awakes after a singularly realistic dream. It
was a dream to her, unreal, impossible. She could
not imagine herself doing what she had done; in
short, she knew she had never done it. That she
should have let off a firearm at human beings was an
act so impossible as to make it seem laughable.</p>

<p>She went to the office with apprehension. What
would happen? How would Gibeon receive the
news? Her apprehensions were needless. Gibeon
received the news apathetically. In the first place,
the town did not know exactly what had happened
and was inclined to place little credence in rumors.
Most of it strolled past the office before noon, seeking
with wary eye for evidences of the war, and
finding none. A scanty few passed through the
door to speak with Carmel about it. Apparently
Gibeon was not interested.</p>

<p>Somehow this hurt Carmel’s pride. Girl-like, she
felt herself to be something of a heroine, and wanted
folks to recognize her eminence. But even her own
staff seemed not to take that view of the matter.
Tubal was sullen; Simmy was silent and frightened;
Evan Bartholomew Pell failed to revert to the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
at all. He had retired more deeply than ever within
his shell of pedanticism, and his supercilious air was
more irritating than ever before. Carmel was hurt.</p>

<p>She did not know how shaken Evan Pell was, nor
the effect upon him of his discovery that a woman
could be of such importance in his life as he found
Carmel to be. With women he had no dealings and
no experience. They had been negligible in his life,
existing only academically, so to speak. Women
and fossil specimens and remnants of ancient civilizations
and flora and fauna had occupied somewhat
similar positions in his experience, with women in
the least interesting position. He did not know them
as human beings at all. They had never troubled
him in the least. Nothing had ever troubled him
greatly. He had always considered them in the mass,
as a genus, to be studied, perhaps, as all created things
should be studied. But never until Carmel’s advent
had he entertained the idea that one of them might
become personally important to him. Evan would
have been no more astonished to find himself involved
with a diplodocus than he now was to discover
his throbbing personal interest in an individual
woman.</p>

<p>He was angry with Carmel. Somehow she had
done something to him. He was affronted. He had
been taken advantage of, and now he was considering
what action to take. Decidedly Carmel must
be put in her place, once for all, and the disagreeable
situation with all its dreadful possibilities must be
terminated with finality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Evan turned in his chair and felt for his glasses,
which were absent.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee,” he said, in his most pedagogical
voice, “may I have your attention briefly?”</p>

<p>Carmel faced him with some trepidation.</p>

<p>“Last night,” he said, “moved by an excitement
to which I fancied myself immune, certain words
were surprised from me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember,” Carmel said, weakly.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he said, “you <i>do</i> remember. Your
manner toward me assures me of your complete
recollection.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“However, in order to avoid misapprehensions I
shall refresh your memory. My words, and I remember
them exactly, were as follows: ‘I believe I’ve
fallen in love with you.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>that</i>,” said Carmel, as if the matter were of
no moment.</p>

<p>“That.... Exactly. Er—your physical peril
aroused in me an excitement and apprehension most
distasteful to me. I have been puzzled for some time
with respect to yourself and the strange effect your
presence has upon me. The matter became clear last
night. I said I believed I was in love with you. That
was inaccurate. I <i>knew</i> I was in love with you.”</p>

<p>“But——” Carmel began. Evan held up his hand
as to an interruption in a classroom.</p>

<p>“If you please.... I discovered a fact, and one
must deal with facts. I slept little last night for
considering this one. I have reached a definite and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
final conclusion, and wish the matter to be understood
between us once for all, and so disposed of.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pell——” Again he imposed silence upon
her.</p>

<p>“I am unable to perceive how this distressing condition
came into being. It was wholly without intention
on my part—against my every instinct. I
do not wish to be in love with you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Quite the contrary. Therefore I wish to impress
upon you that nothing can come of it.”</p>

<p>“And do you suppose——” Once again Carmel
essayed to speak; once more he interrupted.</p>

<p>“Be so good as to allow me to finish. Please understand
my words to be final. I will not marry you.
In no circumstances will I make you my wife. I
do not want a wife.... It is no fault of mine that
I am in love with you, and therefore I shall not permit
myself to suffer for what I cannot help. I shall
take measures to affect a cure, for the thing, as I
see it, is a species of mental ailment.... Therefore,
let me repeat, in spite of the condition in which
I find myself, you need not expect me to become
your husband.... The matter is closed between
us.”</p>

<p>He turned from her abruptly and became much
occupied with the papers upon his desk.</p>

<p>As for Carmel, she was in a state of mind. The
thing manifestly was an outrage, an indignity, a
humiliation, and she was angry. On the other hand,
it was absurd, impossibly absurd, inhumanly absurd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and the laughter which struggled to come was only
repressed by a wave of pity. The pity engulfed
both anger and laughter. Poor, dryly crackling
man! What must his life be without human warmth
and human emotions! She was able to see the thing
impersonally—the dreadful abnormality of his existence,
so that when she spoke it was without rancor
and gently.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pell,” she said, “you need have no apprehensions.
I do not wish to marry you. I am very,
very sorry if you have fallen in love with me....
And I cannot tell you how sorry I am for you.”</p>

<p>“For me?” he said, bristling.</p>

<p>“For you. You are the most pathetic man I have
ever known.”</p>

<p>“Pathetic!”</p>

<p>She nodded. “I have no experience with life,”
she said, gently, “but certain knowledge is born in
most of us. We know that life—real life—consists
only of suffering and happiness. All other things
are only incidents. All the good in life is derived
either from sorrow or joy. If you pass through life
without experiencing either, you have not lived. And,
Mr. Pell, the greatest source of grief and of happiness
is love. I do not know how I know this,
but you may take it as the truth. I have never loved,
but if I felt I never should love, I think I should
despair. I want to love some man, to give him my
life, to make him my life. I want him to be my
world.”</p>

<p>“It is useless to argue,” said Evan Pell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>Carmel flamed.</p>

<p>“Argue!” she said. “Mr. Pell, let me tell you
this, and as you said to me a moment ago, it is final.
If you and I were the sole survivors upon the earth,
I could do nothing but pity you. I am not sure I
could do that. You are abnormal, and the abnormal
is repulsive.... You rather fancy yourself. You
are all ego. Please try to believe that you are of
no importance to anybody. You are negligible.
Whether you live or die can be of no importance to
any living creature.... You are accustomed to look
down upon those who surround you. Don’t you
see how people look down upon you? You think
yourself superior. That is absurd. You are nothing
but a dry running little machine, which can go
out of order and be thrown upon the junk pile at
any time without causing the least annoyance to
anybody. Why, Mr. Pell, if you should die to-night,
who would care? What difference would it make?
What do you contribute to this world to make you
of value to it?”</p>

<p>He had turned and was regarding her with grave
interest. Manifestly her words did not humiliate
nor anger him, but they interested him as an argument,
a statement of a point of view.</p>

<p>“Go on, please,” he said. “Elucidate.”</p>

<p>“Only those who give something to the world are
important to the world. What do you give? What
have you ever given? You have studied. You are
so crammed with dry knowledge that you crackle
like parchment. What good does it do anybody?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
What good does it do you? Did you ever help a
living creature with your knowledge? I cannot
imagine it. You study for the sake of increasing
your own store, not with the hope of being able to
use all your knowledge to do something for the
world. You are a miser. You fill your mind with
all sorts of things, and keep them there. It is utterly
selfish, utterly useless. Think of the great men
whose work you study, the great thinkers and
scientists of all ages. Why did they work? Was it
to hoard knowledge or to give it to the world in
order that the world might live more easily or more
happily? They are important because they were
useful. You—Why, Mr. Pell, you are the most
conspicuously useless human being I have ever
encountered.”</p>

<p>He regarded her a moment before speaking. “Is
your thesis complete?” he asked, gravely.</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“I shall give it my best consideration,” he said,
and turned again to his work.</p>

<p>It was not easy for Carmel again to concentrate
upon the books of the <i>Free Press</i>, which, with only
a limited knowledge of the bewildering science of
bookkeeping, she was examining. Bookkeeping is a
science. It is the science of translating simple financial
facts into abstruse cipher in order that nobody
may understand them except an individual highly
trained in cabalistics. The reason for this is clear.
It is a conspiracy among bookkeepers to make bookkeepers
necessary and thus to afford themselves with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
a means of livelihood.... Carmel was reading the
cipher in order to determine if the <i>Free Press</i> were
in worse or better case for her ownership of it.</p>

<p>Love and bookkeeping are subjects which do not
blend, for, as anybody knows, love is not an exact
science. Also it is a characteristic that love meddles
with everything and blends with nothing. It is intensely
self-centered and jealous. Therefore, as may
be supposed, Carmel had difficulty in arriving at
conclusions.</p>

<p>An ordinary declaration of love must be somewhat
upsetting, even to the most phlegmatic. A
declaration such as Evan Pell had just uttered would
have disturbed the serenity of a plaster-of-Paris
Venus of Milo. Carmel wished to compare circulation
figures; what she actually did was to compare
Evan’s declaration with the declaration of love of
which she, in common with every other girl, had
visualized in her dreams. It would be idle to state
that Carmel had never considered Evan as a possible
husband. It is doubtful if any unmarried woman
ever encounters an available man without considering
him as a possible husband—or if any married
woman, no matter how virtuous, ever passes an hour
in the society of a gentleman without asking herself
if this is the individual with whom she may have
the great love affair of her life. Love, being the
chief business of all women from six to sixty, this is
natural and proper.</p>

<p>Here was a variant of the common situation.
Carmel was informed she was loved, but that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
need expect nothing to come of it. No woman could
like that. It was a challenge. It was an affront.
A gage of battle had been cast, and it is to be
doubted if there is a woman alive who would not feel
the necessity of making Evan alter his views. Carmel
did not want him in the least. Quite the contrary;
but, now he had spoken his mind so brusquely,
she would never be able to live in ease until he came
to want her very much and wore his knees threadbare
begging for her. This was wholly subconscious.
Carmel did not know it, but, nevertheless, she had
determined to make Evan Pell pay fully in the
coin of the transaction for the damage done by his
ineptitude.</p>

<p>With part of her mind on the figures and the rest
on Evan Pell, she arrived at certain information.
Unquestionably the <i>Free Press</i> had been gaining in
circulation. That much she had accomplished. Her
policy of reckless disclosure could have no other result,
and therefore it must have been good journalism.
As for advertising patronage—there, too,
she had made progress. Her personal solicitation
brought in some few new advertisers and resulted
in old patrons enlarging somewhat their space. Also
she had taken some business from Litchfield, the
largest adjoining town, and, on a visit to the near-by
city, she had induced a department store to use half
a page weekly. How much of this she could hold
was a problem. It became more of a problem within
the hour, when no less than three of her patrons called
by telephone to cancel. The Busy Big Store canceled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
a full page which Carmel had labored hard to get;
Lancelot Bangs, photographer, and Smith Brothers’
grocery ceased to be assets—and no one of them
assigned a reason. It worried her to such an extent
that she dropped her work and went to see
about it.</p>

<p>Her first call was upon the proprietor of the
Busy Big Store. This gentleman was embarrassed,
and consequently inclined to bluster, but Carmel,
being a persistent young person, cross-examined him
ruthlessly.</p>

<p>“I got to borrow from the bank,” he said, finally.
“No merchant kin git along without accommodation.
Bank says I’m wastin’ too much money advertisin’,
and it can’t back me if I keep on.”</p>

<p>“So you take orders from the bank?” she asked,
hotly, out of her inexperience.</p>

<p>“You kin bet your bottom dollar I do,” he said.</p>

<p>Carmel bit her lip. “Abner Fownes is a stockholder
in the bank, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“One of the biggest.”</p>

<p>Carmel turned away and left the store. She had
run down her fact. No more was necessary. She
knew why merchants were canceling their contracts
with her—it was because Abner Fownes issued
orders to do so. For the first time he showed his
hand in overt act. The question now was: How
many merchants in Gibeon could Abner Fownes control?
How long could he continue to dictate to
them?... What good was circulation increase if
advertising patronage failed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>She returned to the office in lowest spirits and considered
her case. It was not pleasant consideration.</p>

<p>She had arrived in town a few weeks before, a
stranger, without friends. She was unacquainted
with Gibeon and with its peculiarities, and at the
very beginning had made an enemy of its leading
citizen, a man ostensibly possessed of great power
to blight her prospects. She had made no friends,
had not sought to strengthen her position by alliances.
Frankly, she knew almost as little about Gibeon
to-day as she knew the hour of her arrival. Her
acquaintance was altogether with the melodramatic
side of the town’s life, with the disappearance of its
sheriff; with illicit dealings in liquor; with its political
trickery. She did not know who were its
solid, dependable, law-respecting citizens. It might
have been well to go to the trouble of finding who
of Gibeon’s residents were in sympathy with her
campaign of disclosures, but she had not done so.
She stood alone, without the approval of those who
worked with her.</p>

<p>She saw how she had plunged into things with
her habitual impulsiveness, without giving consideration
to facts or consequences. Without intending
it to be so, she had so arranged matters that the battle
stood as the <i>Free Press</i> against the world. How
much better it would have been to move cautiously;
to be sure of her ground; to know she could rely
upon powerful support. She wondered if it were
too late....</p>

<p>At this stage in her reflections, George Bogardus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
undertaker, darkened her door. George was not a
youth, but he simulated youth. He wore the sort
of clothes one sees in magazine illustrations—with
exaggerations. He wore spats. A handkerchief with
a colored border allowed its corner to peer from his
breast pocket, and useless eyeglasses hung from a
broad black ribbon. If George were seen standing
in the window of some clothing store catering to
the trade of those who dress by ear rather than by
eye, he would have been perfection. Once George
saw a play in Boston, and since that day he had
impersonated a young English nobleman who had
been its hero. His speech was a quaint mingling
of New England intonation and idiom with what he
could remember of the inflections and vocal mannerisms
of Lord Algernon Pauncefote.</p>

<p>“Aw—I say,” he began, lifting his eyeglasses to
his nose. “Aw—Miss Lee.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Bogardus.”</p>

<p>“I say—this is the day we kin start depositin’ our
votes, hain’t it?... What?”</p>

<p>“In the Handsomest-Man contest?”</p>

<p>“Er—precisely. Y’understand—aw—have no interest
myself. Not the least.” This was Lord
Pauncefote at his best. “Buy m’ friends. What?
Cheerio! Eh?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Mr. Bogardus.”</p>

<p>“Er—say, who else has got any votes in?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, as yet.”</p>

<p>“Satisfactory, very. Yes, yes.... Lance Bangs
hain’t entered yit?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“I fawncy ’e will be,” said Mr. Bogardus. “Aw—permit
me to—er—deposit with you—aw—eighteen
of these so-called coupons.... Guess that’ll give
me as good a start as any, seems as though.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Mr. Bogardus. Good luck to you.”</p>

<p>“Er—notice anything?” He toyed with the ribbon
on his eyeglasses and cast an arch glance upon
Carmel.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, indeed! How distinguished it makes you
look!”</p>

<p>He purred. “That’s the way I calc’late to look.
How was it that feller said it in French. Seems like I
can’t twist my tongue around French.... Eh?...
Oh, dis-tan-gay. Sounds kind of, don’t it. Say.”</p>

<p>He turned toward the door, but paused. “Heard
the news?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What news?”</p>

<p>“Aw—fawncy an editor askin’ that. Fawncy!...
They’re goin’ to declare the office of sheriff
vacant and git the Governor to appoint Jenney to
the job.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“It’s bein’ talked all over. Jenney says so himself.
Rippin, eh? What?”</p>

<p>So they dared go as far as that—to appoint to the
high office of sheriff of the county a man such as
Deputy Jenney! The thought was not without its
pleasant facets. If she had forced them to take such
a step it must mean she was reckoned as dangerous....
She hugged that thought to her breast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVAN BARTHOLOMEW PELL was thinking.
He had been thinking for hours, and according
to present rate of progress, it would be hours more before
he arrived at a conclusion. He had found an
interesting subject—one discovered rather later in
life than by most people, but, perhaps, all the more
interesting for that reason. The subject was himself.</p>

<p>It is a fact that never until to-night had he thought
about himself as the ordinary run of human beings
think. When he had given consideration to himself
it had been a sort of aloof, impersonal consideration.
He had often thought about Evan Pell’s mind—as
one thinks of a warehouse—and much consideration
had been given to filling it with intellectual merchandise.
No consideration whatever had been given
to moving away any of that merchandise out of
the warehouse and distributing it.</p>

<p>His requirements had been of the simplest—food,
shelter, and an opportunity to lay in intellectual
goods, wares, and merchandise. With pleasure he
had been unacquainted, and hence felt no desire to
possess it. Sorrow was unknown to him. On the
whole, he was rather like a chess-playing automaton,
except that his range was somewhat wider and more
complicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>But now he had discovered himself as an individual.
The discovery was wholly due to Carmel
Lee. He had fallen in love with her, which was a
monstrous thing, but potent to prepare the soil of
his mind for undesired crops. Then she had spoken
to him about himself with frankness and logic. He
was not disturbed by the frankness, but his antecedents
rendered him apt to perceive the logic. That
had impressed him. What was the use of himself,
anyhow? Such was the question he considered. His
object was acquisition, not dissemination. Had he
been mistaken in choosing that object? This led
further. What were human beings for? Why had
people to be born, and to live? He recognized the
necessity of utility. Was he inutile?</p>

<p>It was ten minutes after midnight when he admitted
he was inutile, or nearly so. What followed?
There followed immediately a disagreeable sensation,
a sense of humiliation. He, a representative,
undoubtedly, of the highest order of human beings,
was not useful. Members of much lower orders were
useful. The ditch digger was useful; the man who
collected the garbage was useful. In that event
diggers and garbage men must be of more value
to the world than himself.</p>

<p>This was intolerable. He could not allow such a
state of affairs to persist, but the method of abolishing
it was not manifest. Mentally he tabulated
the attributes of such patently useful things as he
could remember, looking for their lowest common
denominator. It appeared to be something like what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Carmel Lee declared it to be—namely, improving
some aspect of life upon this planet. If one could
touch any phase of life and render it more efficient,
he was useful. He wondered what aspect of life he
could improve. And then he came to the most important
and far-reaching discovery of his life. This
discovery came at exactly ten minutes past one in the
morning.... In order to find how one might be
useful to life, one must know life! That was the
discovery, and it quite overturned his conception of
how he would live and die.</p>

<p>Inexorably his mind forced him to a corollary.
In order to know life, one must know human beings.
He elaborated on this. It meant mingling with human
beings, taking part in their lives, watching and
comprehending the significance of the ramifications
of their actions and emotions. It was something one
could not derive from books, unless, as he had heard
vaguely, works of fiction depicted these things with
some degree of verity. But he never read fiction.</p>

<p>All of this led to another alarming discovery.
This came at two o’clock in the morning. It was
this—that learning, simply as learning, was not worth
a tinker’s dam. Of course this is not his phraseology,
but it expresses his thought. Learning stored in
the mind’s warehouse is like gold not taken from the
mine. It is no good even to the possessor. You
have to mine and smelt gold before it takes on a
measurable value. It has to be put into circulation in
some form. The same was true, necessarily, of
knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>This meant the overturning of his whole life, for
Evan Pell, besides being logical, possessed another
quality of greater value—when he perceived that
any act was the act to be done, he set about doing
it to the best of his ability. This was not courage;
it was not resolution; it was natural reaction.</p>

<p>At three o’clock he retired. It was with a sense
of humiliation he lay down on his bed. Instead of
being, as he had fancied, a wonderful and superior
being, he was negligible. His resolution, taken with
characteristic finality, was that in the morning he
would begin to be the thing he was not. This was
very fine, but it possessed one defect: It was purely
academic. It emanated wholly from the head, and
not in any fraction whatever from the heart. Emotionally
he did not give a hoot what became of
humanity.</p>

<p>He awoke to a strange world in the morning—felt
like a fresh arrival in a strange planet. His duty was
to find out what the planet was about and, so to
speak, make preparations to take out naturalization
papers. How to begin?... Well, he must eat, and
therefore it was essential to continue at his present
employment. He thought about his present employment
superciliously until he caught himself at it; then
he considered his employment logically. Hitherto
he had taken no interest in it, except as it offered a
challenge to his intelligence. Carmel had doubted his
ability to do the work, and, in irritation, he had
essayed to prove he could do that as well as anything
else. The thrashing he had taken from the fists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
of Deputy Jenney had reached deep enough to touch
his latent manhood—to blow upon the ember derived
from some sturdy ancestor.... Now he considered
briefly the business of news purveying, and was able
to see how serviceable it was to mankind. The business
of a newspaper, as he saw it, was to give to the
community the agenda of the world, and, by editorial
argument, to assist in the business of directing public
opinion.... This was a worthy business....
More specifically he gave thought to the <i>Free Press</i>
and what it was trying to do. Carmel, rushing in
where angels feared to tread, was endeavoring to cure
a definite, visible sore on the public body. For the
first time he viewed the activities of Gibeon’s liquor
smugglers as a matter of right and wrong, and not
as a problem set in a textbook. If he could help to
abolish this malignant sore he would be performing
real service.... That aspect of matters interested
him. He found that the mere mental exercise of
thinking about humanity gave one an emotional
interest in humanity.... He was progressing.</p>

<p>One could not attain to results in a laboratory without
intimate contact with specimens; one could not
attain to results in the world without intimate contacts
with human beings. Therefore Evan made up
his mind to procure for himself a mantle of sociability....
He wore it to the office, and Tubal was
the first human being to see it exhibited. Tubal was
mystified.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Tubal,” said Evan, with painstaking
courtesy. “How do you do this morning?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Er—we must become better acquainted, Tubal....
I trust I make myself clear. Yes, yes. I wish, at
your leisure, to converse with you—er—regarding—ah—many
things. Yes, indeed.... I wish to obtain
your viewpoint.”</p>

<p>Tubal stared, and reared back on his heels
mentally.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel dizzy or nothin’, do ye?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am perfectly well. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Aw—nothin’.... Say!... Looky here.
Viewpoint, is it? Aw....”</p>

<p>“What I wish to convey,” said Evan, and he unmasked
a smile which was decidedly to his credit,
“is—that I wish to be friends.”</p>

<p>Tubal regarded him suspiciously, but Tubal’s eyes
were keen and his perceptions keener. He saw embarrassment
in Evan’s smile, and sincerity, and something
else which might have been called pitiful.</p>

<p>“I’m doggoned!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Evan sighed. This business of making human
contacts was more difficult than he imagined. “I—you
know—I fancy I <i>like</i> you,” he said.</p>

<p>Tubal waved his hands, a fluttering, distracted sort
of waving. “’Tain’t licker,” he said to himself.
“Must be suthin’ he et....”</p>

<p>“Er—we will resume the subject later,” said Evan,
“when both of us have more leisure.... Ah, good
morning, Simmy. I trust you slept well.... The
weather is—ah—satisfactory. Do you not find it
so?”</p>

<p>Tubal leaned against the press and swallowed three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
several convulsive times. Then he turned upon
Simmy fiercely. “Go wash your face,” he shouted.</p>

<p>Evan backed away a step and then beat a retreat.
He sat down at his table and leaned his head on his
hands. Obviously the thing had not been properly
done. The results were quite other than he desired,
but why? He had unbent. He had been friendly,
made friendly overtures. What was wrong?</p>

<p>At this unsatisfactory juncture Carmel entered,
looking very young and fresh and dainty. Evan
forgot his disappointment for the moment in his
delight at seeing her. He stared at her as a hungry
child stares in a bakery window. The sensation was
highly pleasurable. He detected this and took immediate
measures to suppress it.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee,” he said, with some hesitation, “I gave
careful consideration to your yesterday’s arraignment
of myself.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I had no intention to wound you, Mr.
Pell. I—I hope you will forgive me.”</p>

<p>“You did not wound me. Er—quite the contrary....
As I say, I reflected upon what you said. I
slept little. Unquestionably you were right.... I
have lived in error. My estimate of myself was
mistaken. I have, in short, been of negligible value
to the world.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pell!”</p>

<p>“If you please.... I have reached a determination
to revolutionize my life. I shall no longer stand
aloof. No. I shall participate in events.... Indeed,
I have made a beginning—not altogether auspicious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
I essayed to make friends with Tubal this
morning, but he seemed not to comprehend my meaning.
However, I shall persist.... As to yourself—we
are not friends, you and I. You do not rate me
highly.... I wish to correct this.” He paused.
“As I have been compelled to inform you, I have
fallen in love with you.... This moment, as you
entered, I glowed with pleasure.... Yesterday
I informed you you need expect nothing to come
of it. To-day I am in doubt.... I desired to hold
myself free from—er—such things as marriage.
Doubtless that, also, was a mistake.... I am
open-minded.”</p>

<p>“You—you—are open-minded!” Carmel gasped
out the words.</p>

<p>“Exactly. I have determined to allow the emotion
to follow its natural course, without interference by
myself. Even if it results in marriage with you, I
shall not interfere.”</p>

<p>“Of all things,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Meantime, while the more important matter is
working itself out, let us endeavor to be friends.”
As he said this there came into his voice a wistfulness,
a humility which touched her. Her eyes filled.
She held out her hand.</p>

<p>“Friends!... Of course we shall be friends!
You must overlook my bad temper. I have so many
faults.”</p>

<p>His eyes glowed, his face became animated.
“You,” he said, eagerly, “are very lovely. You are—er—wonderful....”
He stared at her as if she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
been an apparition. Carmel caught her breath and
turned away abruptly.</p>

<p>So much for Evan Pell’s effort to break through
his chrysalis shell.... The fates had not determined
if he were to become a moth or a butterfly....</p>

<p>At that very hour Abner Fownes was opening his
mail. His frame of mind was not of the pleasantest,
though he had succeeded in tiding over the day before
a situation financially threatening. The condition
of his affairs was wearing upon him. Constant
calls for money, demands upon his shiftiness to
prevent a <i>débâcle</i>, never-failing watchfulness, bore
heavily upon the man. It was not easy to maintain
his attitude of high-spirited public citizen. It was
not simple to keep beneath the surface the man who
lurked under the skin of the fatuous cat’s-paw. It
was difficult to maintain the pretense of being used
by smaller men, when constantly he had to twist
smaller men to his own ends.</p>

<p>Now he opened with trepidation a letter from a
lumber concern with which his dealings had been
extensive.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have received yours of the 20th with respect to renewing
your note for $18,750 which falls due two weeks from
to-day. We regret that in present conditions this is impossible,
and must ask you to take up this paper without fail.</p>
</div>

<p>Fownes crumpled the letter in his hand and stared
at the paneling of his office as if he hoped by the mere
venom of his look to reduce it to ashes. His pudgy,
beautifully tailored shoulders moved upward so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
his short neck disappeared and his ears rested upon
his collar. Then he expelled his breath. He arose
and went to the safe, which he opened—to which he
alone possessed the combination—and took from its
resting place the red leather book in which he kept
the true record of his and his company’s condition.
This he carried to his desk, and for many minutes
he studied it, hoping against hope for some expedient
to make itself apparent.... There was no
expedient.</p>

<p>He returned the book to its place and locked the
safe; then he twisted the handle of the telephone insistently,
and gave Central the number of the Court
House.</p>

<p>“Deputy Jenney,” he said, arrogantly.</p>

<p>The deputy answered.</p>

<p>“Come to my office immediately,” he said. “Never
mind who sees. This is imperative.... At once.”
Following that, he waited.</p>

<p>Deputy Jenney entered, breathless, and stood
panting.</p>

<p>“Jenney,” said Fownes, “I’ve determined to make
another investment.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Already.... Why, we hain’t hardly got
the last off’n our hands. It’s takin’ a chance, says I,
and crowdin’ the mourners.”</p>

<p>“I’m running this business, Jenney.... This
next is to be no retail deal, either. It’s wholesale.”</p>

<p>“You—you want to go easy. By golly! Mr.
Fownes, so much stuff comin’ in is goin’ to git
somebody mighty curious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“If you’re sheriff, Jenney, what will the curiosity
amount to?”</p>

<p>“Federal officers!”</p>

<p>Fownes shrugged his shoulders. “I’ll see to your
appointment as sheriff. You attend to organizing
everybody to receive the shipment. We’ll need all
available space and all outlets. I’m going to fetch
in enough this time to flood the county.”</p>

<p>“You know what you’re doin’,” Jenney said, sullenly,
“but what with that damn paper a-peckin’ at
us all the time——”</p>

<p>“Nobody reads it, Jenney. And you’ll be sheriff.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my dumdest—but I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t care whether you like it or not. And
that’s that. Better see Peewee first.”</p>

<p>“When’s it comin’?”</p>

<p>“Inside of ten days.... And, Jenney, I don’t
believe the paper’s going to bother much longer.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to—er—give that girl a hint of our
plans.”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>“I’m going to give her a tip, as they say. She’ll
investigate, and that professor will investigate.”</p>

<p>“Like Sheriff Churchill did?”</p>

<p>“The result,” said Fownes, “will be similar.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“YOU are not,” said Evan Pell to Carmel Lee,
“familiar with laboratory practice—er—with
chemical analysis, for instance.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it?”</p>

<p>“I judged not,” he said, unwittingly reverting to
his patronizing manner. “However, it seems to me
the individual who searches for truth—in the happenings
of the day—would be better fortified for his
labors if he applied the methods of the chemist.”</p>

<p>“As, for instance?”</p>

<p>“Let us suppose there has been a crime. The
crime is a result. An inevitable result of the combination
of certain elements. Given the crime, the
chemist should be able to analyze it and to separate
its elements.”</p>

<p>“I believe that is the method of story-book detectives.”</p>

<p>“No.... No.... This is science, logic. A
simple example. You hold a substance in your hand.
You moisten it with iodine. If the substance turns
purple you know starch is present. Do you see?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t see.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of Abner Fownes?” he asked,
with uncharacteristic swerving from the subject.</p>

<p>“I think he is abominable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Possibly.... But impersonally, as an individual—what
then?”</p>

<p>“He is a pompous, self-deceiving, hypocritical
poseur.”</p>

<p>“Uh!... As to intelligence?”</p>

<p>“As your chemist would say—a trace.”</p>

<p>“I fear,” he said, “you have neglected to moisten
him with iodine.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” he said, “that you have utterly failed to
comprehend what you are facing—what it is you have
to do in this headstrong crusade of yours against the
liquor smugglers.”</p>

<p>“What has that to do with Abner Fownes?”</p>

<p>“That,” he said, “is the big question.”</p>

<p>“But why should he? That is absurd. Perhaps
the smugglers are using him as a cat’s-paw in some
manner—but he’s rich. There’s no need. These
men take the risks they must for profit.”</p>

<p>“Miss Lee,” he said, “you—er—challenged me to
investigate this affair. I promised to do so.... I
have set about it in an orderly manner.”</p>

<p>“So I imagine,” she said, a trifle wearily.</p>

<p>“I have started with the compound itself—with
the fact that we know there exists a wholesale traffic
in liquor, from which a huge profit is derived. This
is compounded of many small elements. I think we
may take it as fact that the hunchback, Peewee Bangs,
is an element; that his hotel is another element; that
Deputy Jenney is a rather important ingredient. For
myself, I am satisfied numerous citizens of Gibeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
are involved—in the distribution and marketing of
the liquor. I am quite certain, for instance, that the
business of taking photographs is not the sole means
of livelihood followed by Lancelot Bangs.... He
is, I believe, a cousin to the proprietor of the Lakeside
Hotel.... These things are present in the compound,
but they could not, joined together, cause the
result we see. The principal ingredient is missing.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?”</p>

<p>“A daring, ruthless intelligence. Able leadership.
The brain capable of conceiving of bootlegging as an
industry, and not as a matter of petty retailing.”</p>

<p>Carmel Lee was impressed. Evan Pell possessed
the quality of holding interest, of seeming to speak
from sure knowledge.</p>

<p>“I think you are right so far. What we need is
to find this intelligence.”</p>

<p>“I rather fancy I have found him. In fact, I have
had little doubt as to his identity for a considerable
time.”</p>

<p>“Abner Fownes?” She shrugged her shoulders.
“I dislike him—he is insufferable—but the idea is
absurd. Bumptious little men like him, secure in their
wealth and position, do not jeopardize it.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Evan, “is dependent upon their security.
What would you say if I were to tell you
Abner Fownes has been on the brink of bankruptcy
for months? What would you say if I told you
this rum running commenced only after his finances
became tangled? What would you say if I told you
the major part of the profits from this liquor business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
went to maintain Abner Fownes in the character
he has assumed, and keep his imperiled
business out of the hands of his creditors?”</p>

<p>“I would say,” she said, “that you are crazy.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” he said, “I am convinced of the
fact.”</p>

<p>“But he has no brains. Look at him. Observe
him.”</p>

<p>“Miss Lee, it takes a man of tremendous resolution
and of very keen intelligence to invent for himself
a character such as he has exhibited to Gibeon for
years.... If the world supposes you are a nincompoop—a
vain figurehead—a puppet set up by
other men—you are little in danger of arousing suspicion
as to yourself. When a man is commonly
admitted to be a fool, he is safe. Fownes has been
at infinite pains to prove himself a fool.”</p>

<p>Carmel was far from dull. Her mind flashed to
the keystone of the arch Pell was constructing.
“Show me he is on the verge of bankruptcy and
maybe you can convince me of the rest.”</p>

<p>He told her. He itemized the contracts Fownes
had made for the purchase of lumber, and the prices
at the time of sale. He showed how the market
had declined, and the total sum of Fownes’s losses.
“These,” he said, “are facts—not public, but easy to
come by.... I first found the trail of them when
the cashier of the bank asked me to assist him in an
audit of the books. That was some months ago
when I occupied my official position.”</p>

<p>“But if you are right, then Abner Fownes is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
murderer, or an instigator of murder.... Nobody
can look at him and credit that.”</p>

<p>“Abner Fownes,” said Pell, “is capable of any
crime to preserve Abner Fownes. I have watched
him, studied him. I know.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe.... It is incredible. No. You
must be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Miss Lee,” said Pell, solemnly, “if you wish to
continue to exist, if you hope to come through this
affair with your bare life, you must believe. If you
cannot believe, pretend it is a fact and act accordingly.
Forget everything else and concentrate upon Abner
Fownes.... But take this warning: The moment
he suspects you suspect him—you will doubtless join
Sheriff Churchill.... I believe Churchill was on
the road to the discovery. He would not have disappeared
otherwise.”</p>

<p>Carmel remained silent, considering. At length
she spoke. “You are right,” she said. “One does
not insure his house because he believes it will burn,
but in case it shall burn. I shall make believe you
are right about Abner Fownes—as an insurance
policy.... But where does that lead us?”</p>

<p>“To the sheriff’s office,” said Pell.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“If Jenney is appointed sheriff to succeed Churchill,
where is the machinery to fight Fownes? He
could laugh at us. Therefore Jenney must not be
appointed.”</p>

<p>“But how can that be averted?”</p>

<p>“I think,” he said, “the sole hope lies in yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“In me!”</p>

<p>“You must find a man, a man of courage, of public
spirit. You must find a man who can be relied upon
and whose name will carry weight with the Governor....
When you find him, you must go to the Capitol
and make the Governor appoint him—and you must
act at once.”</p>

<p>“I?... I go to the Governor?”</p>

<p>“You.... If you could carry a petition, signed
by a number of citizens, it would strengthen you, but
I don’t see how that can be done.... And yet—and
yet——”</p>

<p>“It must be done.... Secretly.”</p>

<p>“To approach one man—who would talk, who
was on the other side—would be to ruin the whole
project.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it must be done.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “First find a man
worthy to hold the office,” he said.</p>

<p>“I shall find him.... I know Mrs. Churchill.
She will know her husband’s friends and supporters—the
men who worked for his election and whom he
trusted.”</p>

<p>“The idea is good,” said Evan. “Suppose you
act without delay.”</p>

<p>Carmel found Mrs. Churchill in the kitchen, giving
a hearty welcome, in spite of her baking, to the
visitor.</p>

<p>“Set,” said Mrs. Churchill, “and lemme pour you
a cup of tea. Always keep it simmerin’ on the back
of the stove in case of headache.” This was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
favorite fiction of Mrs. Churchill’s—that she suffered
with her head and that tea was the only remedy.
It would appear, however, that she used the beverage
as a preventive instead of a cure.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I haven’t time to sit this morning.
I’ve come to you because you’re the only person in
Gibeon who can help me—and because you are the
one most interested in helping me.... I want to
know whom to trust.”</p>

<p>“Eh?... Trust? Speakin’ of young men, be ye?”</p>

<p>“No.” Carmel smiled as she saw the fire of
matchmaking light Mrs. Churchill’s motherly eyes.
“I want to know whom your husband trusted. I’ve
got to find a man.... Deputy Jenney is going to
be appointed sheriff,” she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill’s eyes flashed. “In my man’s place!
That critter!”</p>

<p>“If,” said Carmel, “I can’t find an honest man—one
like your husband—and <i>get there first</i>.”</p>

<p>“Uh huh....” said Mrs. Churchill, ruminatively.
“He wa’n’t much give’ to talkin’, but more’n
once he says to me, says he, ‘The’ hain’t many in
this place I’d trust as fur’s I could throw ’em by
the horns,’ he says. But I call to mind that whenever
he got kind of out of his depth like, and had
to talk things over with somebody, he allus went to
spend the evenin’ with Jared Whitefield. Him and
Jared was close. I don’t calc’late you’d make no
mistake goin’ to Jared and statin’ your case.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Carmel. “There’s not a moment
to be wasted. Good-by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>She did not return to the office, but walked out
the main street, past the village cemetery, to the
rambling, winged house from which Jared Whitefield
ruled his thousand-acre stock farm—a farm he
had carved himself out of the forest, cleared,
stumped, and planted. She knew the man by sight,
but had never held conversation with him. He was
not an individual to her, but a name. She opened
the gate with trepidation, not because she feared
the reception of herself, but because she was apprehensive.
Mr. Whitefield, when studied at close range,
would not measure up to the stature of the man she
felt was needed.</p>

<p>A dog barked. A voice silenced the dog. Carmel
noted how suddenly the dog quieted when the voice
spoke. Then a man appeared around the corner of
the house, an ax in his hand, and stood regarding
her. He did not bow, nor did he speak. He merely
stood, immobile, as if some cataclysm of nature had
caused him to burst through the soil at that spot,
and as if there still remained embedded roots of
him which anchored him forever to the spot. He
was big, straight, bearded. At first glance she
thought him grim, but instantly decided it was not
grimness, but granite immobility. She approached
and greeted him.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Whitefield,” she said.</p>

<p>He inclined his head and waited.</p>

<p>“I am Miss Lee, proprietor of the <i>Free Press</i>,”
she said.</p>

<p>“I know ye,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Surely he was difficult; but for all that, she felt
herself drawn to the man. There was a feeling that
if she could scale his granite sides and sit upon the
shelf of his shoulder she would be safe—that nothing
could topple him from the spot where he had
taken root.</p>

<p>“I want to talk to you, Mr. Whitefield. It is a
matter of great importance—almost of life and
death,” she said.</p>

<p>“Say it,” said Jared Whitefield.</p>

<p>“They’re going to appoint Deputy Jenney sheriff,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Know it.”</p>

<p>“It mustn’t be.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Is it safe to speak here. A word overhead——”</p>

<p>“This is my yard,” said Jared, and there was
much, much more in the words than the mere statement
of the fact. It was a declaration of independence.
It was a guaranty. It lifted Jared out of the
commonplace and made a personage of him—the unquestioned
ruler of a principality. Where he was,
he ruled.</p>

<p>“You know what my paper has done.”</p>

<p>“Lighted matches nigh a powder keg.”</p>

<p>“I believe, and I hope to prove, there is an organization
here for the purpose of wholesale dealing in
smuggled liquor. I believe that organization murdered
Sheriff Churchill. I believe Jenney is a part
of it and that his appointment as sheriff is a move
to give the criminals safety in their work. I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
there are huge profits. At the top is some man of
intelligence who directs. I want to get that man.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“I think Sheriff Churchill knew—or guessed.
That’s why he is dead.”</p>

<p>“Uh!... Wa-al?”</p>

<p>“Our only chance is to block Jenney’s appointment.
To get first to the Governor with the name of another
man—a man whose name and personality
carry weight. If we can get the office of sheriff
we are halfway to success.”</p>

<p>“Will Abner Fownes back the man you pick?
Go to the Governor fer ye?”</p>

<p>She looked at him briefly, moved a step closer,
and lowered her voice.</p>

<p>“Abner Fownes,” she said, “is the man I believe
to be the chief of the rum runners. I believe he
gave the word to kill Sheriff Churchill.”</p>

<p>Whitefield moved for the first time. He ran a
hand through his beard and drew a breath like a sigh.</p>

<p>“Life insured?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You will be my life insurance.”</p>

<p>She took him by surprise; his features actually
changed for an instant. “Me?” he said.</p>

<p>“When you are sheriff,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’m fifty. By mindin’ my business I got twenty-odd
year to live.”</p>

<p>“He was your friend,” she said.</p>

<p>There was a long silence while she watched his
face, and he, looking over the top of her head, stared
at the field and woodland stretching to the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“He was my friend,” said Jared Whitefield.</p>

<p>“Then you will?”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done. Fownes has the say.”</p>

<p>“I think it can be done. Will you let me try?”</p>

<p>He considered in his ponderous way. Then he
turned without a word and walked away. He proceeded
half a dozen steps and then halted. “Yes,”
he said, over his shoulder, and continued on his way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARMEL walked back rapidly, but her pace did
not interfere with the activities of her mind.
She had many things to reflect upon, and not the
least of these was a sudden realization that Evan
Bartholomew Pell had, of a sudden, as it were, taken
command. It was he, rather than herself, who had
risen to the emergency. He had seen the necessities
of the situation. He had comprehended the situation
itself as she had never done. While she had
been obeying impulse he had been acting intelligently.
It was true he seemed to have little tangible evidence
to work upon, but, somehow, she felt he would be
able to find it. The amazing thing was that, without
effort, without seeming to do so, he had moved
her into secondary place. He had told her what to
do, and she had done it without question.... Evan
was a surprising person, a person of submerged
potentialities. She wondered just what kind of man
he would be if he ever came to himself and came
into his own personality. In addition to which, Carmel,
like all other women, could not but give careful
consideration to a man who had declared his love
for her.</p>

<p>Then there was Jared Whitefield to appraise. She
liked him, but found herself somewhat in awe of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
his granite impassivity. She felt he had looked
through and through her, while she had not been
able to penetrate the surface of him. She had talked;
he had listened. He had made his decision, and
wholly without reference to herself, or to what
she had said to him. But, on the other hand, he
seemed to have washed his hands of the responsibility
for his appointment as sheriff. If it could be managed—well
and good. He would serve. But that
seemed to be all. He offered no assistance, no suggestion.
He had said “Yes” and walked out of the
boundaries of the matter.</p>

<p>Jared Whitefield was a personality, of that she was
certain. He was a man to impress men, a man to
rule, a man never to be overlooked.... Why, she
wondered, had he remained inactive in Gibeon. Apparently
he had rested like a block of granite beside
a busy thoroughfare, negligent of the bustle of passing
traffic. What, she wondered, did Gibeon think
of Jared. How would he appeal to Gibeon as its
candidate for sheriff?</p>

<p>She reached the office and found Evan Pell waiting
for her.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p>“I’ve found the man, and he has agreed to serve.”</p>

<p>“What man?”</p>

<p>“Jared Whitefield.”</p>

<p>He nodded, almost as if he had known it from the
beginning. It irritated her.</p>

<p>“You’re not surprised at all,” she said sharply.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it would have required colossal stupidity
to choose any other man—and you are not
stupid.”</p>

<p>She looked at Evan with curiosity, and he sustained
her gaze. He was changed. She saw that he
had been changing through the days and weeks,
gradually, but now he seemed to have made some
great stride and reached a destination. He did not
look the same. His face was no longer the face of an
egoistic pedant. It was not alone the laying aside
of his great, round spectacles. The thing lay rather
in his expression and in his bearing. He seemed
more human. He seemed larger.... She was
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“The petition,” she said. “I must have that.”</p>

<p>“Signatures would be easy to get. There are a
hundred men who would sign any petition with
Jared Whitefield’s name on it. Men of standing.
But to approach one man who would go to Abner
Fownes with the story—well——” he shrugged his
shoulders. “I don’t suppose one man in a hundred
realizes what is going on under the surface in
Gibeon.”</p>

<p>“We must take the risk.”</p>

<p>“I’ll prepare the petitions and have Tubal print
them—at once.”</p>

<p>She sat down at her desk and wrote a moment,
then got up and walked with steady steps into the
composing room. Evan Pell stood looking after her
with a queer expression; it was a look of loneliness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
of yearning, of self-distrust, of humility. He was
thinking about Evan Pell and of what a failure he
had made in the handling of his life. He was considering
how little he knew, he who had fancied himself
of the wisest. He weighed the value of book
knowledge against the value of heart knowledge,
and found himself poverty-stricken.... It seemed
so hopeless now to turn himself into the sort of man
he wanted to be; the sort of man he had come to comprehend
it was worth his while to be.</p>

<p>“I never would have found it out,” he said to himself,
“if I had not loved her.”</p>

<p>The door opened stealthily and a barefoot urchin
entered whose clothing consisted of trousers many
sizes too large and a shirt so dirty and torn as not
to resemble a garment at all. He glared at Evan and
snarled:</p>

<p>“Where’s she?”</p>

<p>“Where’s who?” said Pell.</p>

<p>“The editin’ woman.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of her?”</p>

<p>“None of your business.... Hey, leggo of me,
damn you! I’ll bite ye! Leggo!”</p>

<p>Pell had the child by the nape of the neck and held
him so he could not escape. He noticed a paper
crumpled in one grimy hand and forced the fingers
open. It fell to the floor, and as he reached for it
the boy wriggled free and darted out to the sidewalk,
where he grimaced horribly and twiddled his
fingers at his nose. “Ya-aaa-ah!” he squealed, and
fled down the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Pell smoothed out the paper and read, in cramped,
printed letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They hain’t treated me square and I’m getting even. They’re
fetching it in to-night. Truckloads. You can git evidence at
the Lakeside. Eleven o’clock.</p>
</div>

<p>That was all, no signature, nothing to indicate the
identity of the writer. Evan folded the paper and
thrust it into his vest pocket. He looked through
the door of the composing room and frowned. The
line of his mouth was straight and narrow. Eleven
o’clock, at the Lakeside Hotel!... Queerly enough,
the thought flashed into his mind. What drew
Sheriff Churchill out of his house on the night of
his disappearance?... Evan passed through the
swinging gate and sat down at his table just as Carmel
re-entered the room.</p>

<p>“Who was in?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Nobody,” said Evan Pell. “Just a kid asking
for blotters.”</p>

<p>She would go to the Lakeside Hotel. It was not
in her character to do otherwise. She would go,
she would place herself in peril. Had the note come
into her hands, he had no doubt she would have
concealed it and have gone alone.... Well, she
did not receive it. She would not go. That much
was sure.</p>

<p>Carmel spoke. “There goes Abner Fownes,” she
said, and, turning, he saw the well-known equipage
with the coachman on the front seat and Fownes,
pompous, making a public spectacle for the benefit
of an admiring public, bolt upright in the rear seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“He’s going some place,” said Carmel. “See. He
has a bag.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Pell. He remembered that Fownes
had been absent from Gibeon on the night Churchill
had disappeared. “Yes, he’s going some place.”</p>

<p>They watched the equipage until it disappeared,
making the turn toward the railroad station.</p>

<p>“Tubal will have the petitions in ten minutes,” she
said. “How will we go about getting signatures?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that matters,” he said, absently.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon.... Er—signatures. Of
course. Signatures.”</p>

<p>“What ails you, Mr. Pell. Of course, signatures.
We weren’t speaking of potatoes.”</p>

<p>His manner was strange, she thought. He seemed
a trifle pale. Was he ill?... No, he said, he was
not ill, he was afraid he had been a trifle absent-minded.
Carmel eyed him sharply. The thing did
not look like absent-mindedness to her.</p>

<p>He arose and went to the telephone. “Give me
the station, please,” he said, and then waited. “Is
this the station? This is the <i>Free Press</i>....
Yes.... No news? Um!... Just saw Mr.
Fownes going past with a bag. Thought he might
be going away. We like to print something when
people go away.... Bought his ticket?... To
the capital, eh?... Thank you.” He hung up
the receiver, and there was a look of profound
relief on his face. This was surprising to Carmel.
Why he should be relieved by learning Fownes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
was on his way to the capital was beyond her
comprehension.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee,” he said, “there will be no time to get
signers to a petition.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because you must start at once for the capital.”</p>

<p>“But the train is leaving. It will be gone before I
can get to the depot.”</p>

<p>“Abner Fownes is going to see the Governor,”
he said. “There can be but one reason for it. He
has decided he needs a sheriff. He’s gone....
It is a six-hour trip by rail, with the change at
Litchfield.”</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>“By automobile one can make it in five hours—or
less.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“If you will go to your hotel, please, and dress and
pack a bag, I will have a car waiting for you here.”</p>

<p>She frowned. This was giving orders with a
vengeance.</p>

<p>“I’m still owner of this paper,” she said.</p>

<p>“Please, Miss Lee,” he said, and there was humility,
pleading in his voice. “Don’t be unreasonable
now. This must be done. Nobody can do it but you.
Please, please make haste.”</p>

<p>She did not want to obey. It was her desire to
rebel, to put him once for all in his old subordinate
place, but she found herself on her feet in obedience.
He compelled her. He had power to force her
obedience. She was amazed, angered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“I shan’t——” she began, in a final effort to
mutiny.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee,” he said, gravely, gently, and she was
touched and perplexed by the gentleness of his voice,
“you have spoken to me of service, of forgetting
oneself to be of service to others.... Please forget
yourself now. You are not doing this for me or for
yourself.... It is necessary.... I beg of you to
make haste.”</p>

<p>There could be no refusal. She passed through
the gate and found herself walking with rapid, almost
unladylike strides, to the hotel. Up the stairs
she rushed and into her room. In five minutes she
was redressed in a gray tailored suit. Then she set
about packing her bag, and, singularly enough, the
first thing she put into it was an evening gown, the
gown which she had worn but once, and that to the
final ball at the time of her graduation. Why she
included this dress she could not have said, unless
feminine vanity were at work—a hope that an opportunity
to wear it might present itself.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes she re-entered the <i>Free Press</i>
office. A touring car stood at the door, with a young
man, strange to her, behind the wheel.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” she said to Evan Pell.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, quietly. Then: “Don’t let
anything prevent you from coming to the Governor.
You will know what to say. See him before Abner
Fownes gets his ear ... and ... and come back
safely.” His voice dropped, became very low and
yearning, as he spoke these final words. “Come back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
safely—and—try not to think of me as—harshly as
you have done.”</p>

<p>“I—have never thought of you harshly,” she said,
affected by his manner.</p>

<p>He smiled. “I am very glad I have loved you,”
he said. “Will you please remember I said that,
and that it came from my heart.... It is the one
fine thing which has come into my life.... It
might have changed me—made me more as you would—less
the man you have criticized.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Pell!... You speak as if I were
never to see you again. I shan’t be gone more than
a day.”</p>

<p>He smiled, and there came a day not far distant
when she remembered that smile, when it haunted
her, accused her—and gave her a strange happiness.</p>

<p>“One never knows,” he said, and held out his hand.
She placed her hand in his, and then he performed
an act so out of tune with Evan Pell, pedant and
egoist, that Carmel gasped. He lifted her hand to
his lips. The gesture was not artificial, not funny.
There was a grave dignity, a sincerity in the act
which made it seem quite the right thing to have
done. “Good-by,” he said. “You are very lovely....
Please make haste....”</p>

<p>He helped her into the car, and she turned. “Mr.
Pell——” she said, but he was gone, had returned
to the office and was invisible.</p>

<p>“Ready, miss?” the driver asked.</p>

<p>“You know where you are to go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Whose car is this?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Whitefield’s,” said the driver, as he threw in
his gear and the machine moved up the street.</p>

<p>Carmel’s mind was not on the car, nor on its destination,
nor upon her errand. It was upon Bartholomew
Pell.... Could she have seen him seated
before his table, could she have read his thoughts,
have comprehended the expression of happiness upon
his face, she would have thought even more urgently
of him.... For he was saying to himself: “Thank
God she’s out of it. She’s safe. I’ve done that
much, anyhow.”</p>

<p>He drew the mysterious note from his pocket and
studied it attentively. “She would have gone,” he
said, “so I shall go.... Doubtless it is a trap of
some sort—but it may not be.... And she is safe—she
is safe.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARMEL wondered how one went about it to obtain
a private interview with a Governor. She
was still young enough and inexperienced enough in
life’s valuations to regard a man in that position as
necessarily above the ordinary run of men. His
office invested him with a certain glamour, a fictitious
greatness. Governors, Senators, Presidents!
Youth invested them with a terrific dignity. It is
somewhat difficult, even for the wise and prudent,
to see the man apart from his vestments; to understand
that there is, in reality, very slight difference
between human beings, and to approach those in authority
with the sure knowledge that, no matter how
lofty their position, they have, at best, but two arms
and two legs, a fondness for mince pies, and a failing
for colds in the nose. Governors quarrel with their
wives, and have ingrowing toe nails. The forty-eight
of them, heads of the several states of the
Union, remind one of the main street in a boom
town—two stories on the sidewalk, but a ramshackle
shed in the rear....</p>

<p>No sooner did the dome of the Capitol appear
through a break in the wheels than Carmel began to
dress herself mentally for the meeting. She had a
horrible fear she would become tongue-tied and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
thrust her thumb in her mouth like an embarrassed
little girl who has forgotten her piece.... She
glanced at her watch. It was five o’clock.</p>

<p>How late did Governors work at governing?...
She directed her chauffeur to drive to the Capitol,
and there she alighted because she had no idea what
else to do. She climbed the imposing steps and
entered the building. It was a repellent sort of place;
a mausoleum of assassinated ambitions, and it chilled
her. The corridors were all but deserted.</p>

<p>Leaning against a column adjacent to a brass cuspidor
was an old man in a uniform which might
have been that of a prison guard, a janitor, or a retired
street car conductor. Carmel approached him.</p>

<p>“Where will I find the Governor?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows,” said this official, and made a generous
and accurate contribution to the receptacle.</p>

<p>“Who does know?” Carmel asked, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I hain’t here to locate governors. I show folks
through the buildin’, and mostly they give me a
quarter a head.”</p>

<p>“Well, show me to the Governor’s office and I’ll
give you fifty cents a head,” Carmel said.</p>

<p>He peered at her, took a last, regretful look at the
cuspidor and sighed. “’Tain’t wuth it,” he said,
sententiously. “’Tain’t wuth fifty cents to see no
Governor I ever knowed, and I’ve come through the
terms of six.... Foller me.”</p>

<p>Grasping at straws, she questioned him. “What
sort of man is the Governor.”</p>

<p>“The kind that can git himself elected to office,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
said her guide. “Allus worked at it. Had his snoot
in the trough since his fust vote.”</p>

<p>“Is it difficult to see him?”</p>

<p>“Depends on who you are.”</p>

<p>“Supposing you’re just nobody.”</p>

<p>“If ye hain’t got nothin’ to <i>give</i>, ye hain’t got
nothin’ to git nothin’ <i>with</i>.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to approve of him.”</p>

<p>“Him! Don’t think nothin’ about him. He’s jest
the Governor. Be another next year, and then another
and another. He’s all right as Governors go.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell me <i>anything</i> about him?” she asked,
desperately.</p>

<p>“He’s dark complected and takes a spoonful of
bakin’ sody after each meal,” said the guide. “There’s
his office.... Said fifty cents, didn’t ye?”</p>

<p>Thus fortified for her encounter, Carmel opened
the door and found herself in a large reception room
where were two or three unoccupied desks, and one
at which a young man was seated. He looked up
as she entered, scowled, but as he comprehended her
trim loveliness he manipulated his face into a smirk
and got to his feet.</p>

<p>“I wish to see the Governor,” she said.</p>

<p>“Have you an appointment?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He advanced with an ingratiating air. “Well, I
might be able to fix it for you....”</p>

<p>“Suppose you try at once,” she said, for his kind
was well known to her, as to any pretty girl. His
chin dropped. “Take in my card, please,” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
The young man revised his estimate. She was pretty,
but she was <i>class</i>. Class, in his dictionary, meant
anyone who could not be approached by the likes of
himself. She might even be important. Sometimes
women were important. They had rich or influential
fathers or husbands. At any rate, here was one
it would be unsafe to approach with blandishments.
She was able to peg him neatly in the board as an
understrapper. He took her card and disappeared
through an adjoining door.</p>

<p>Presently he reappeared.</p>

<p>“His secretary will see you,” he said, and as she
walked past him he scowled again, and hated her
for showing him his lack of importance in the world.</p>

<p>The Governor’s secretary arose courteously as she
entered. She appraised him at once; recognized him
for what he was, for the mark was strong upon him—a
newspaper man, rewarded for services by his position.
He was young, intelligent, sure of himself.
She knew he would have no awe of personages.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee?” he said, glancing at her card.</p>

<p>“I wish to see the Governor.”</p>

<p>“You have no appointment?”</p>

<p>“None. I drove from Gibeon on a matter of grave
importance—almost of life and death to our town.
I must see him.”</p>

<p>“A pardon case?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“If you will state your business, I will see what
can be done. The Governor is very busy, of course,
and cannot see everyone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“My business is private. I can tell it only to the
Governor himself—and I must see him.... I must
see him.”</p>

<p>His face was not unfriendly as he regarded her
for an instant. “The Governor is not here. He has
gone. However, if you will come back at—say—ten
o’clock to-morrow, I will see that you get a
minute with him.”</p>

<p>“I must see him now—to-night. To-morrow will
not do.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, but you can’t possibly see him.
He is giving a dinner in the Executive Mansion, and
a ball this evening. You can see for yourself....
He could not be disturbed. There are important
guests. Our Senator is here.”</p>

<p>She could see. The Governor’s day’s work was
ended. His social day—an important social day—was
beginning, and in such circumstances it would be
impossible to penetrate to him.... She twisted her
hands together and bit her lip.... By this time
Abner Fownes’s train would be arriving in the city.
<i>He</i>, doubtless, would have access to the Governor at
any time. Possibly he was to be a guest at the function....
If he were, if he found the Governor’s
ear, her mission would come to nothing.</p>

<p>“Is there no way—no way?” she asked.</p>

<p>“None, I am afraid.... But at ten to-morrow....”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, heavily. Then, “Is it a
large party?”</p>

<p>“Not a public function. Not small, but very exclusive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Our senior Senator, you know, is very important
socially.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Carmel. “Thank you again.” She
found herself again in the outer office, and then in the
corridor, making her way toward the stairs. Near
the door she saw again her guide, close to the copper
receptacle which seemed to have won his affection.</p>

<p>“See him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t calc’late ye would,” he said. “Seen him
go home an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Been poorer by half a dollar if I had,” he said,
succinctly.</p>

<p>She was driven to the hotel, where she registered
and was shown to her room by a bell boy. No sooner
had he closed the door and departed with her gratuity
in his hand than she threw herself down on the bed
in very girlish despair.... She had failed. Singularly
enough, it was not the failure itself which stung
her; it was the fact that Evan Bartholomew Pell
would know of her failure.... She had failed <i>him</i>.
This was an incomprehensible state of affairs, and
when she discovered it she was shocked. What
difference did it make what Evan Pell thought, or
how he regarded her failure. It was none of his
business, anyhow. The paper was hers, and he nothing
but a poorly paid employee.... It was all very
well to tell this to herself, but the fact remained. She
could not go back to Gibeon and confess failure to
Evan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>She sat erect, hands clenched. Her teeth pressed
her lips. “A man would see the Governor. He would
manage it. I’ve a <i>right</i> to see him. His business
is with affairs like mine, and not with dances....
I will see him. I’ll make him see me!”</p>

<p>There was a way, because there is always a way to
accomplish everything.... Her thoughts came in
fragmentary form, chaotic. Abner Fownes was in
the city, perhaps in this very hotel. She tried to
reason about him. What if he were a guest at the
dinner.... That was a possibility to consider, and
she scrutinized it. No, she concluded, he was not
to be a dinner guest. Being a dinner guest of the
Governor’s was not a fact he could have kept secret.
It would elevate him in Gibeon’s eyes. He would
never keep to himself a fact like that. Gibeon would
have been informed. It would have been informed
days ago so that Abner could have basked in this
new glory!... But would he be at the ball? That
was not to be determined. In politics he was important,
and, ball or no ball, if he demanded an
interview, the Governor would grant it. And he
would demand an interview. He had journeyed to
the capital in haste. This meant he had immediate
need for Jenney’s appointment as sheriff.... He
would see the Governor to-night!</p>

<p>Carmel opened her bag and thanked God for the
impulse which had included her evening gown in her
equipment. She laid it out on the bed and smoothed
it.... Presently she was taking a bath, refreshing
herself, and feeling very adventurous and almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
happy. With characteristic neglect of impediments
and consequences, she had taken a resolution—to be
an uninvited guest at the Governor’s ball.</p>

<p>She telephoned for something to eat—to be sent
to her room, for she feared to go to the public dining
room, lest she encounter Fownes. At all costs Abner
must be kept unaware of her presence. She was
as relieved as if full success were hers, and she
dressed with animation and pleasure. When she
looked in the glass she could not help reflecting that,
if she were not an invited guest at the ball she would
not be a discredit to it.</p>

<p>It was difficult to wait. She paced up and down
the room, planning, discarding plans. She endeavored
to foresee obstacles and to remove them. She
imagined, and enjoyed the imagining, dramatizing
the whole evening in advance. She endowed the
Governor with the qualities history gave to Abraham
Lincoln—more especially in those episodes where he
is reported to have arisen from important affairs of
state to listen to the story of some wife or daughter
whose loved one was to be executed for sleeping on
his post. Yet she did not even know what the
Governor looked like. His photographs—yes. She
had seen his face, but it was not familiar to her,
nor whether he was tall or short, brawny or slender....
The picture she painted made him big, broad
of shoulder, with a fine, high forehead, noble eyes,
and a fatherly manner. Perhaps he would address
her as child, and, with courtesy, lead her to some
private spot where she would pour her story into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
his sympathetic ear. He would be amazed, startled,
confounded at the news of such a state of affairs in
the commonwealth he governed.... And he would
act. He would send her away from him with the
precious appointment in her hand ... and with
lofty words of praise....</p>

<p>She watched the time. It seemed as if days passed
instead of hours before she telephoned down for her
car. But when she issued from her room to descend,
her dreams melted into damp fog and she was terrified.
She feared to encounter Fownes at every step.
Her heart almost stopped beating as she imagined
terrible incidents. Suppose she were stopped at the
door! Suppose, once inside, credentials should be
demanded of her! Suppose the Governor’s wife
should approach with a horrible society air and eye
her scornfully and demand by what right she was
there! She might be the center of a scene, might
be expelled from the place! Almost she repented.
Almost she returned to her room. But something
compelled her to go on.... The only
courage is that which compels one in spite of his
terror.</p>

<p>The car was waiting. “The Executive Mansion,”
she said, and sank back in her place, quivering.</p>

<p>Presently, too soon, they drew up before the
awning which stretched from the Governor’s door
to the street. A servant opened the car door and
she alighted. He bowed elaborately. Carmel took
it for a good omen. There was no questioning her
of her right to be present.... A certain security<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
came of the knowledge that she looked as if she belonged
in this world.</p>

<p>She mounted the steps and was bowed into the
hall. No question was asked. Servants took charge
of her and directed her. She mounted the stairs,
found herself in a room with a number of women,
who glanced at her indifferently. A maid took her
wrap. In this security she lingered as long as she
could find excuse—putting off the moment when she
must descend.... An elderly woman was leaving
the room, and Carmel, quick to grasp opportunity,
left in her wake, keeping close to her on the stairs.
Side by side they entered the ballroom—as if they
were together. Carmel regarded the elderly dame
as her ticket of admission.</p>

<p>The orchestra was playing a fox trot; the room
was vivid with color.... She paused, searching for
the man she had come to see, but could not discover
him.... Summoning what assurance she could, she
entered the room and skirted it, her eyes on the
dancers. She paused, looking for a seat.</p>

<p>At the end, beyond the orchestra, was an alcove,
and she moved toward it, entered it. Here was an
observation post. She turned to find a chair from
which she could watch the ballroom, and as she did
so a man entered from a door at the left. Her hands
flew to her breast and she choked back a scream.</p>

<p>She was face to face with Abner Fownes!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARMEL was astonished at herself; she discovered
herself to be cool and self-possessed;
determined rather than frightened. Here was an
emergency; her one thought was to prove adequate
to it.... It was a thing to have been expected.
Abner Fownes’s face reassured her—it informed
her intuition rather than her intelligence. It wore
an expression such as would have been more suitable
to one in Carmel’s position—an interloper in danger
of being detected and ejected from the house. His
eyes were something more than startled or surprised.
They were unbelieving. She saw it was hard for
him to comprehend her presence; that, for some
reason, it was inconceivable she could be there. She
knew, through some psychic channel, that it was not
the fact of her being at the Governor’s function
which nonplused him, but rather the fact of her not
being somewhere else—in some spot where he had
expected confidently she would be.</p>

<p>His face mirrored the sensations of a man whose
plans have gone wrong unbelievably. He was angry,
almost frightened, at a loss. She took command of
the situation before his moment of weakness passed.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Fownes!” she said.</p>

<p>“G-good evening!” he answered. “What—how——”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Then he smirked and drew himself up to the
full realization of his stature. He resumed character.
“I did not know,” he said, pompously, “that
you were an acquaintance of the Governor’s.”</p>

<p>“May it not be possible,” Carmel said, sweetly,
“that there are a number of things you do not know?”</p>

<p>“Young woman, you are impertinent,” he said,
drawing his shoulders upward and his neck inward
very much like a corpulent turtle in a state of exasperation.
He was laughable. Carmel smiled and
he saw the derision in her eyes. It must have been
maddening to a man accustomed for years to deference
and to adulation—maddening and not to be
understood. “I have warned you,” he said. “My
patience nears the breaking point.”</p>

<p>“And then?” Carmel asked.</p>

<p>For the first time she saw the man, the real Abner
Fownes. Lines, cultivated by years of play-acting
in a character part, disappeared from his face. His
chins seemed to decrease in number; his cheeks to
become less pudgy; his eyes less staring and fatuous.
His jaw showed strong and ruthless; his eyes turned
cold and deadly and intelligent. She saw in him a
man capable of planning, of directing, of commanding
other men—a man who would pause before no
obstacle, a man whose absurd body was but a convenient
disguise for a powerful, sinister personality.
He was no longer ridiculous; he was dangerous,
impressive.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee,” he said, “for reasons of your own
you have gone out of your way to antagonize me....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
I was attracted to you. I would have been your
friend. I credited you with brains and ability. I
would even have made you Mrs. Fownes.... You
would have been a credit to me as my wife—I believed.
But you are not intelligent. You are very
foolish.”</p>

<p>There was no threat, no rancor. There was even
a certain courtesy and dignity in his manner, but it
frightened her more than rage and bluster could have
done. It was the manner of one who has made up his
mind. His eyes held her eyes, and a feeling of helplessness
spread over her like some damp, cold
wrapping.</p>

<p>“If you do not return to Gibeon,” he said, “I will
forget your antagonism.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying?”</p>

<p>“Your presence in Gibeon has become an annoyance.
If you do not return—it will be wise.”</p>

<p>“Not return!... To Gibeon, and to the <i>Free
Press</i>! You are absurd.”</p>

<p>“In a few days there will be no <i>Free Press</i>,” he
said.</p>

<p>“There will be a <i>Free Press</i> in Gibeon,” she answered,
“long after the bankruptcy courts have settled
the affairs of Abner Fownes.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she knew she had been again the
victim of impulse; she had betrayed knowledge which
she should not have betrayed. Fownes was expressionless,
but his eyes glowed like sun upon sullied
ice.</p>

<p>“I have no more to say to you,” he said, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
was a finality in his words which conveyed more
than the sense of the words themselves. It was as
if he had spoken a death sentence.</p>

<p>He turned to the door and walked away from her
with that pompous waddle which was not so absurd
when one realized how invaluable it was to the man
and how painstakingly he must have cultivated it....
A servant peered into the alcove and entered
with a yellow envelope in his hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fownes?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“A telegram, sir. The Governor said he saw you
come in here, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Fownes said and tore open the
envelope. He read the message slowly, then stood
staring at it thoughtfully while Carmel held her
breath. She sensed a menace in the telegram, something
which threatened her and her enterprises.</p>

<p>He turned and peered at her, and there was something
saturnine in his eyes, almost mocking.</p>

<p>“I imagine this concerns you,” he said. “It is
from Deputy Jenney. It may interest you.” He
read, “‘Whitefield out for sheriff. Miss Lee left
town in his automobile.’” He shrugged his shoulders.
“I wondered how you got here,” he said after
a moment. Then, “How did you get in here?”</p>

<p>“That is the Governor’s affair, not yours,” she
said.</p>

<p>“True,” he answered. “Suppose we leave it with
him.”</p>

<p>He turned to the waiting servant. “Ask the Governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
to step here, please. Tell him it is important.”
Then to Carmel. “It will not be embarrassing for
you to see the Governor?”</p>

<p>“I came to see him.”</p>

<p>“Uninvited.”</p>

<p>She made no answer. She was frightened, quivering.
What could she say? What could she do?
When the Governor appeared and she was denounced
to him as an intruder, as a woman who forced her
way into a private entertainment, how could she
reach his ear with her petition?... Would not the
fact of her being an intruder make her case hopeless?
She set her teeth. At any rate she would
make a fight for it, and at worst there could be nothing
but ignominious expulsion at the hands of some
servant. The thought of that was unbearable. She
was a woman, with a woman’s social consciousness
and a woman’s delicacy. It seemed more terrible to
her to be detected in such a breach of society’s laws
than it would have been to be detected in a crime....
For a moment she was unnerved.</p>

<p>She thought of her mission; of the public importance
of what she was doing and the excellence
of the motives which had brought her to do the thing
she had done. This availed little. The humiliation,
the public humiliation, would be as terrible. She
meditated flight.... But then there arose in her a
stubbornness, a resolution. Back of it was this
thought—“<i>He</i> is depending on me. <i>He</i> sent me to
do this. <i>He</i> looks to me to succeed.” The <i>he</i> was
emphasized. It did not occur to her to wonder how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Evan Bartholomew Pell came to be of such importance
to her in this moment, or why the fact that he
was relying upon her should sustain her in this crisis.
Nevertheless, it was so. She felt she would possess
his approval, no matter what came, if she persisted,
if she did not give up so long as there was the shadow
of a chance of success. She felt, she knew, he would
consider as negligible any sneer of society, any personal
humiliation sustained. She knew he would
persist, and from this she drew strength....</p>

<p>She saw a tall, handsome man approach the alcove.
From dimly remembered lithographs she knew him
to be the Governor, and as he approached in his
dignified way, she studied him. He looked like a
Governor. He was smooth-shaven, appearing
younger than his years. He carried a look of authority,
the presence of a personage. It was a fine
presence, indeed, and one of incalculable value to
him. It had been his chief asset in reaching the
height to which he had climbed.... Her scrutiny
told her nothing more than this. The man who approached
might be a great man, a statesman, a man
of tremendous depth and character—or he might be
nothing but an appearance. She hoped he was a man.</p>

<p>He entered and extended his hand to Fownes.
“Glad you ran up,” he said, cordially. “I saw you
come in, but couldn’t break away. How is Gibeon?”</p>

<p>“Gibeon,” said Abner, “is flourishing.”</p>

<p>The Governor turned his eyes from Fownes to
Carmel, and they lighted an instant in tribute to her
loveliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Your daughter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You don’t know the young woman?” Fownes
said.</p>

<p>“It is my misfortune,” said the Governor.</p>

<p>“Um!... Possibly. Then, as I supposed, she is
not here at your invitation?”</p>

<p>The Governor looked from one to the other of
them, and seemed distressed, embarrassed. He
sensed a tenseness, a situation, and, of all things, he
hated to face situations.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” he said.</p>

<p>Carmel stepped closer. “Governor,” she said, “I
am not a guest. I came to see you to-day on an important
matter—a matter of life and death. I went
to your office, but you had gone. It was necessary
to see you to-night.... So I came. I am an intruder—but
I will go as quickly as I can.... After
I have spoken with you.”</p>

<p>Fownes shrugged his shoulders and laughed.</p>

<p>“The young woman deserves to get ahead,” he
said, “if effrontery can win success.... But, unfortunately,
I know her, Governor. She owns a
bankrupt, blackmailing rag in Gibeon.... That is
unimportant, but, otherwise, I am sure your wife
would not care to have her rubbing elbows with her
guests.... In Gibeon——” he paused to allow the
innuendo to take effect. “To prevent unpleasantness,
or any chance of her recognition here, the best thing
will be to call a servant and show her quietly to the
street.”</p>

<p>Carmel knew such hot rage as she had never known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
before. She could have struck Fownes. Hot words
sprang to her lips, but she suppressed them, fought
for self-control. She laid a tiny hand on the Governor’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, “you occupy a great position this
state. Thousands of people look up to you for the
qualities you must possess.... Fairness must be
among them. I insist that you listen to me now....
Abner Fownes, you have lied, deliberately and
maliciously. You know there is no reason why I
should not be here, no reason why any man or
woman should object to my presence. It was a
cowardly lie—told because you were afraid.”</p>

<p>“Shall I call a servant—to prevent a scene? Your
guests may overhear.... It wouldn’t read well in
the papers.”</p>

<p>The Governor hesitated, for he was a vacillating
man, timorous, a mirror reflecting stronger images
than his own.</p>

<p>“I—— Possibly you had better go quietly,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I shall not go,” Carmel said. “You shall hear
me. I will not leave except by force—and then you
will have your scene.... It is too late for me to
care what happens now. If you dare to eject me I
promise you a scene....”</p>

<p>“But—er—young woman——”</p>

<p>“My name is Miss Lee, and you will address me
so,” she said. “If you will listen to me five minutes,
I will go.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Fownes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Why did she come? What is it all about? This
is most unpleasant,” said the Governor.</p>

<p>“Why did I come? What is it about.... It is
about <i>murder</i>!”</p>

<p>“Murder!... What—murder?”</p>

<p>“The murder of Sheriff Churchill of Gibeon.”</p>

<p>“But he was not murdered. He ran away, absconded.”</p>

<p>Fownes laughed. “You have all the facts in that
matter, Governor.”</p>

<p>“I think so....”</p>

<p>“You have no facts.” Carmel clutched his sleeve.
“This man, if he has given you the facts you have,
has lied to you.... Sheriff Churchill is dead. He
did not abscond. He was killed doing his duty by
men who feared detection.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying? What is this, Fownes?
What does she mean?”</p>

<p>“Politics,” said Fownes, in a voice he tried to
keep steady.</p>

<p>“It is not politics. Sheriff Churchill was lured
from his home and killed. I know. By the crowd
of men in Gibeon who are making themselves rich by
smuggling whisky over the border.... There is a
wholesale traffic, Governor. I have seen it. I, myself,
discovered a <i>cache</i> of hundreds of bottles in the
woods.... It is no petty bootlegging, but a great,
wholesale traffic....”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Fownes.</p>

<p>“The headquarters of it is the Lakeside Hotel.
That is the point of distribution.... Deputy Sheriff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Jenney, whom this man has come to ask you to
appoint sheriff in Mr. Churchill’s place, is a crony
of the proprietor. He is in it, as I shall prove. But
he is not the head of it.... These men, because I
printed in my paper what I discovered, came to wreck
my plant. I believe they are ready to do with me
as they did with Sheriff Churchill.... So I have
come, I have forced my way to you, to beg you not
to make that appointment. It gives these lawbreakers,
these murderers, control of the legal machinery
of the county. Governor, do you know Jared
Whitefield?”</p>

<p>“I—do,” said the Governor.</p>

<p>“He is a good man, a capable man, an honest man,
and he has agreed to accept the appointment as
sheriff and to clean out this association of lawbreakers.
That is my purpose in coming here—to
ask his appointment of you.”</p>

<p>“Whitefield!—Whitefield!... What’s this?
What’s this about Whitefield, Fownes?” The Governor
was bewildered. Whitefield’s name completed
his consternation. He despised conflict of any sort
and political conflict most of all. When influential
men fell out it agitated him, especially if he were
asked to take sides. He had gone forward in the
world by keeping in mid-channel, making no contacts
with either shore. He had done extraordinarily well
by never making up his mind and by availing himself
of the opportunities other people dropped....
If there was trouble between Whitefield and Fownes
it would mean taking sides.... Whitefield! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
knew what Whitefield was capable of, and Fownes—Fownes
was supposed to control his county. He
quite lost sight of the specific matter in hand in his
agitation over distant political aspects.</p>

<p>“Whitefield’s out of politics. This woman’s just
raked up his name. He’s dead.... She lies.”</p>

<p>“But—he’s got a following. Not only in his
county. There was talk of his running for Governor
once.”</p>

<p>“There would be again if you gave him this appointment,”
said Fownes, adroitly. “Now Jenney
deserves the place. He knows the machinery of the
office—and I want him to have the job.”</p>

<p>“Jenney’s a brute and a criminal. If you appoint
him you’ll outrage the decent people of the whole
county—and I’ll take care they know how and why
you appointed him,” said Carmel. Her courage was
in its place again. She was not afraid, but she was
desperate. “I’ll tell the people how the Governor of
this state rewards a man for being a party to the
murder of a public official. It won’t sound well.”</p>

<p>“But Churchill wasn’t murdered. He—he absconded,”
said the Governor.</p>

<p>“He was murdered. That man knows it.” Carmel
cast off all discretion. “I believe he ordered the
murder. I know he is the head and brains of this
liquor-smuggling conspiracy.... I suspect he’s
plotting to put <i>me</i> out of the way.... He’s bankrupt.
Do you know that, Governor. He’s fighting
off his creditors, keeping his head above the surface
with money he gets from smuggling and selling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
whisky.... That’s Abner Fownes. That’s the
man who asked you to appoint his Man Friday sheriff....
You dare not do it, Governor.... You’ll
be a party to murder if you do.... Oh, Governor,
please, please see this thing as it is. It’s an opportunity....
We can break this thing up; we can
destroy this traffic going on under the surface of
Gibeon, turning decent people into lawbreakers....
I tell you”—her voice lifted as she spoke—“I tell you
Abner Fownes is as guilty of Sheriff Churchill’s
murder as if he did it with his own hand.”</p>

<p>Fownes shrugged his shoulders and forced a laugh.</p>

<p>“I told you it was a blackmailing sheet,” he said.</p>

<p>“I know.... But Whitefield. That’s what worries
me. I don’t want a war on my hands.”</p>

<p>“Governor, have you listened to me?” Carmel said,
fiercely. “Have you heard what I have told you—and,
hearing it, are you worrying about petty political
squabbles.... We are talking about <i>murder</i>.”</p>

<p>“I—I must go back to my guests. I’ll take this
matter under advisement.... I’ll have it investigated.
Fownes, why did you get me in this mess?”</p>

<p>“Governor,” said Fownes, “I’m going away from
here with Jenney’s appointment as sheriff in my
pocket.... Think back. It was my county put
you where you are. I swung it for you. I can just
as well swing it against you—and election isn’t far
off.... My county can keep you out of the Senate....
If you listen to a fool girl who is trying to
blackmail me into marrying her—why, that’s your
lookout, but you’re a dead chicken in this state....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Either I get Jenney or I throw every dollar I own
and every ounce of my influence against you. You’re
none too strong.... You shilly-shally. You’ve
listened to a pack of lies, and you know they are
lies. Who is Whitefield, to disturb you?”</p>

<p>“But if there was a murder?”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!... Do I get Jenney or not? Fish,
Governor, or cut bait.”</p>

<p>The Governor looked appealingly at Carmel,
turned his eyes to Abner Fownes. He was an exceedingly
unhappy man.</p>

<p>“You—you have no evidence,” he said. “You
make grave charges, and on nothing but your unsupported
word.... I—in fairness—I do not see
how I can consider them. Charges against a man
of Fownes’s standing.”</p>

<p>Carmel knew she was defeated. Her mission had
been in vain. Such a man as the Governor was to
be reached only by underground channels, by the
political alleys and blind byways so well known to
him.... He was spineless, a figurehead, nothing....
Fownes would get his man, Jenney would become
sheriff, and Gibeon would be abandoned into
the arms of the liquor smugglers.... To her personally
it meant more than this. It meant imminent
danger.... With the machinery for detecting and
apprehending criminals in his hands, Fownes would
find little difficulty in disposing of herself.... She
made one more desperate effort, pleading, cajoling,
arguing—but in vain.</p>

<p>“Shall I call the servant?” Fownes said, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
cold eyes upon Carmel. “I think we have had
enough of this.”</p>

<p>“No scene. We must have no scene. Will you
go quietly, Miss Lee.”</p>

<p>“I will go,” she said, “and Heaven help a state
with such a man at its head....”</p>

<p>She went out of the alcove, ascended the stairs,
and found her wrap. Her automobile drew up as
its number was called, and she entered.</p>

<p>“The telegraph office, quickly,” she said.</p>

<p>At the office she sent two messages—one to Evan
Pell, the other to Jared Whitefield himself. They
announced her failure.</p>

<p>“Can you—will you drive me back to Gibeon
to-night?” she asked the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Mr. Whitefield said I was to do whatever you
wanted.”</p>

<p>“The hotel, then, until I get my bag.”</p>

<p>In twenty minutes she was in the car again, speeding
over the dark roads toward home, heavy of heart,
depressed, weighed down with foreboding.... It
was nearly eleven o’clock. She felt as if she could
not reach Gibeon soon enough, and repeatedly begged
her driver for more speed....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE east was glowing dully with approaching
dawn when Carmel alighted from the car at
the hotel in Gibeon and hurried through the deserted
office and up the scantily illuminated stairs to her
room. She was weary, not in body alone, but with
that sharper, more gnawing weariness of the spirit.
She had failed, and the heaviness of failure sat upon
her.... She could not think. It was only with an
effort she was able to force herself to undress and
to crawl into her bed.... Then, because she was
young and healthy, because she had not yet reached
an age and experience at which troubles of the mind
can stay the recuperative urge of the body, she slept.</p>

<p>It was nine o’clock when she awakened, and with a
feeling of guilt she dressed hurriedly, snatched a cup
of coffee, and hastened to the office. She dreaded to
meet Evan Pell, to confess her inadequacy....
There was another reason, deeper than this, instinctive,
why she hesitated to meet him. It was a sort of
embarrassment, an excited desire to see him fighting
with reluctance. She did not analyze it.... But
she was spared the ordeal. Evan Pell was not in
his place.</p>

<p>There was petty business to attend to, and an hour
passed. Such hours may pass even when one is in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
midst of such affairs as surround Carmel.... Her
last night’s adventure seemed unreal, dreamlike.
Gibeon, going about its concerns outside her window,
seemed very real.... She looked out at Gibeon
and her mind refused to admit the fact that it could
continue normally to plod and buy and sell and gossip
as she saw it doing, if there were anything beneath
its surface. Crime, plotting, trickery, sinister threat—these
could not exist while Gibeon looked and
labored as it looked and labored this morning. The
town should have lagged and whispered; apprehension
should have slowed its steps and stilled its voice;
a shadow of impending catastrophe should have
darkened the streets.... But the streets were bright
with sunlight.</p>

<p>She saw women marketing with baskets on their
arms; she saw farmers passing in automobiles and
wagons; she heard children shouting and laughing....
It was Gibeon—a normal, unexcited, placid
Gibeon. And yet, murder, or worse than murder,
poised over the village on its black wings, poisoning
the air its people breathed!... The whole thing
was absurd.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Pell?” she asked Simmy, who came
in to lay a galley proof on her desk.</p>

<p>“Hain’t been in this mornin’,” Simmy told her.
“Say, George Bogardus’s been in twict to see you.”</p>

<p>Carmel smiled. She knew why George had called.
It was the Handsomest-Man contest.... She considered
that farce, for it was a farce—a makeshift to
gain circulation, a trick played by herself with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
tongue in her cheek.... It had quickened the interest
of Gibeon, however. Gibeon could be made
excited over an absurd voting to decide upon its
handsomest man! It could discuss the thing, gossip
about it, lay small wagers. More than one wife, feeling
bound by self-esteem, had entered her husband
and deposited votes in his name. This, Carmel
judged, was an effort on the part of these women to
vindicate their own judgment; to elevate themselves
in their own esteem; to cry up their own possessions.
Some there were, of course, who laughed, who saw
the absurdity of it, but more remained to take it
with utmost sincerity, and of these George Bogardus,
undertaker <i>de luxe</i>, was perhaps the most sincere.
George neglected his business to pursue votes. But
then, so did Lancelot Bangs!... Single men both,
the mainstay of local haberdashers! The contest had
now arrived at a point where even admiring wives
were discouraged and hoped only to have a husband
who ran third—for Bogardus and Bangs seemed
sure to outdistance the field.</p>

<p>Not only did these young men vie with each other
in the pursuit of votes, but in the purchase of apparel.
If Bogardus imported a yellow silk necktie made more
beautiful by inch-broad polka dots of green, Bangs
answered the challenge with patent-leather shoes
with gray cloth tops cross-hatched with mauve....
Each spent his substance in riotous garments, and
neither neglected, at the busy hour in the post office,
to take up his station before the door, full in the
public eye, to enable the populace to scrutinize and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
to admire. It was a campaign such as no political
election ever had brought to Gibeon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Carmel learned from Tubal, it had come
to personal conflict. As the pair of candidates occupied
their stations, each on his side of the post-office
door, Bogardus had spoken in a manner highly
derogatory of a new hat displayed by his rival for
the first time. It was a hat of Leghorn straw, wide
and floppy of brim. The under side of this brim
was lined with green cloth, either for decorative purposes
or to soften the light reflected to the eyes.
About the crown was folded a scarf, and the colors
in this scarf were such as to detain the eye even as
the sound of an ambulance gong takes possession of
the ear. It was a master stroke. It quite upset
Bogardus to the extent that he forgot the amenities
and, <i>sotto voce</i>, asked the world to tell him
where Lancelot Bangs got hold of the merry-go-round
he was wearing on his head. “All it needs,
by Jove!” said George in his best British manner,
“to make a feller know it’s a merry-go-round is to
have Lance’s brain start playin’ a hurdy-gurdy tune.
Eh? What?”</p>

<p>Battle ensued, and spectators estimated that no
less than forty dollars’ worth of haberdashery was
destroyed by the fury of it. The gladiators were
torn apart—but not until Gibeon had enjoyed the
spectacle to the full. But the spark was lighted.
Rivalry had grown to jealousy; now jealousy had
become hatred. In the hearts of each of these Beau
Brummels burned a fire of malice.... Each was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
now determined, in some manner or another, to eliminate
his rival.</p>

<p>Presently George Bogardus peered through the
office door and, seeing Carmel, entered, bringing with
him a sartorial effulgence overpowering. He rested
his malacca cane against the rail, pulled down his
lavender waistcoat, straightened his tie, lifted his
hat, and bowed from the waist.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee,” he said, “aw—I say, now—d’you
mind if I have a bit of a word with you. Eh?
What?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Mr. Bogardus. What can I do for
you?”</p>

<p>“It’s private. I—aw—fawncy you wouldn’t wish
to be overheard. Not by a darn sight you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Come in, then, and sit here. No one will overhear
us.”</p>

<p>He passed the gate and took the indicated chair,
leaning his elbow on Carmel’s desk and pointing the
tip of his long and almost prehensile nose at her
most convenient ear.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ was said in the rules of this here contest,”
said he, “aw—about the character of the—aw—contestants.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But suthin’ must ’a’ been intended. You wouldn’t
want no crim’nal, nor no wife-beater, nor no—aw—person
addicted to intoxicants to enter, now would
you. Eh?... What?”</p>

<p>“Naturally not.”</p>

<p>“If a contestant was sich, what would happen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“It would be necessary to eliminate him.”</p>

<p>“Cheerio! What price the elimination!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Bogardus?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” said he, “there’s a feller goin’ to be
eliminated doggone quick. An’ mebby go to jail to
boot.”</p>

<p>“This is rather a serious thing to say.”</p>

<p>“Meant serious. Nobody kin claw me and git
away with it. Nobody kin set up to be better dressed
’n I be, by Jove!—aw—and git away with it. I been
watchin’, I have, and what I suspected I found out.
And I’ll swear to it. Eh? What say? Now what,
Lancelot, old dear?”</p>

<p>“You are talking about Mr. Bangs!”</p>

<p>“Lancelot Bangs—that’s him.”</p>

<p>“What has he done?”</p>

<p>“Him? What ho! Oh, I say! Blime if the
bloody blighter hain’t a bootlegger!” Here George
became a trifle confused in his British, but what does
Gibeon know of distinctions between Whitechapel
and the Hotel Cecil?</p>

<p>Carmel was alert at once. This touched the business
in hand. “A bootlegger. You mean he is selling
whisky?”</p>

<p>“Is and has been.... Hain’t bothered much with
photographs for a long spell back. Makes his livin’
that way. It’s how he can afford them handsome
cravats from the city.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

<p>“Take my oath to it in court. I’ve heard and
saw. I’ve tasted out of a bottle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Here was something tangible at last, a hand on a
minor tentacle of the affair, but, if clung to and followed
diligently, it must lead sometime to the octopus
head.</p>

<p>“Where does he get it?” Carmel asked.</p>

<p>Bogardus shook his head. “That’s all I know. He
gits it and sells it. Makes him a criminal, don’t it?
Eh? What?”</p>

<p>“It would seem to....”</p>

<p>“Disqualifies him, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“If I can verify what you have told me.”</p>

<p>“Calc’late I kin fetch you proof,” said George.</p>

<p>“Very well. Do that and he shall be disqualified.”</p>

<p>George arose, bowed, took his cane, and moved
with stateliness to the door. There he paused,
turned, and smirked.</p>

<p>“Cheerio!” he said.</p>

<p>Here was something tangible, a commencement, a
man who had seen and heard and would take his
oath! It had not come in an admirable way, but it
had come—had come as a direct result of the things
she had printed in the paper. The end of a thread
which would pass through many snarls before she
could arrive at the spool, but it would arrive....
If George Bogardus knew so much, other people
knew more. In Gibeon were men willing to talk if
she could attract them to her. But this was slow.
She felt time would not be given her laboriously
to follow clues. She must overleap spaces; must
arrive at something bigger then a petty bootlegger.
Already, as she knew, Gibeon was aware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
that Deputy Jenney was deputy no longer, but
sheriff, full fledged and unassailable.... She must
act, and act quickly—or action would be made impossible
for her.</p>

<p>Bogardus would fetch her proof. She would not
wait for Bogardus.... Impulse sat in the driver’s
seat again. Lancelot Bangs was no strong man; he
would not be difficult to handle. Impulse urged her
to the attack. She did not stop to reason, for when
one feels something must be done, it is so easy to
seize upon the first matter which offers action. She
was on her feet.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back in an hour,” she called to Tubal, and
stepped out upon the street.</p>

<p>Her heart beat a trifle more quickly as she climbed
the stairs to Lancelot Bangs’ photographic parlors—and
as she climbed, she remembered that other visit,
that mysterious conversation in the back room, overheard
by her but not comprehended.... She comprehended
it now.</p>

<p>As she opened the door a bell rang somewhere in
the mysterious depths of those rooms where Lancelot
carried on the rites of photography, and the young
man appeared, a wet print in his fingers.</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Lee,” he said, and preened himself. It
is difficult to preen oneself with a black alpaca apron
on which reaches from chest to knees, but Lancelot
was conscious his shoes and necktie were visible. It
gave him assurance.</p>

<p>“I want to talk to you, Mr. Bangs,” she said.</p>

<p>“Certainly! Certainly! Time’s your’n. Hain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
many visitors like you comes here.... Hain’t never
had the pleasure of makin’ your portrait.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come,” said Carmel, with that disconcerting
directness of which she was mistress, “to talk
about photographs. I came to talk about whisky.”</p>

<p>Lancelot reared back upon his heels and his Adam’s
apple took a mighty heave upward.</p>

<p>“Whisky?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I am going to print in the <i>Free Press</i>
the story of how you sell whisky in your back room.
I shall tell whom you have sold whisky to, how much
you have sold, give the dates.” Carmel was pretending
to more knowledge than she possessed, which,
of course, is the first rule in the game.</p>

<p>“I—You—’Tain’t so. I never sold a drop.
Mebby I give a friend a drink—jest sociable like.
But I hain’t sold.”</p>

<p>“Don’t lie to me, Mr. Bangs. I know.” She
allowed her voice to become less cold. “I don’t want
to be hard on you, but it looks as if I would have to....
There’s just one way you can save yourself
from going to jail.” She dropped that and let it
lay while he looked it over.</p>

<p>“Jail!” he said, feebly.</p>

<p>“Exactly.... If you will make a clean breast of
the whole thing to me, tell me where you get the
liquor, who smuggles it in, all about it, I will give
you forty-eight hours to get away.... I’m not
after you, Mr. Bangs—but I may have to take you—if
you aren’t reasonable.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I never——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>Carmel stood up and turned to the door. “I’m
sorry,” she said. “I’ve given you your chance....
Good-by.”</p>

<p>He clutched her arm. “Hey!—wait! Where you
going?”</p>

<p>“To lay my information before the authorities.”</p>

<p>“They—they said the authorities was fixed.”</p>

<p>Carmel laughed. “That’s better,” she said. “Who
said the authorities were fixed?”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t say that—I didn’t——” He sank on
a red-plush sofa and covered his face.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Bangs, just tell what you know. You
don’t want to go to jail. In forty-eight hours you
can be a long ways from here—and nobody will
bother about you—if they get hold of somebody more
important.... It’s your last chance. Will you talk
or not?” Her hand was on the doorknob again.</p>

<p>“I—I——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“They’ll kill me.”</p>

<p>“Like they did Sheriff Churchill,” she said.</p>

<p>He stared at her goggle-eyed. “Did they do that?”
he asked, in sudden terror. “They didn’t do that.
I didn’t know nothin’ about it. I thought he run
off. I——”</p>

<p>“They won’t kill you if you get away,” she said.
“Now tell me what you know. Quickly!” she snapped
out the last word of command as a school-teacher
might speak to a refractory child.</p>

<p>“I—I been sellin’.... Not much. Jest a few
cases—once in a while—when I could git it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“How much?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know exactly. Sometimes I’d git a
dozen cases. Sometimes less.”</p>

<p>“Made quite a nice living for you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t git it all. I jest got my commission....
I had to pay back most of the profit.”</p>

<p>“How did you get the whisky?”</p>

<p>“A feller would come and tell me the’ was a shipment
comin’. Then I’d git in my car and go out
to git what was assigned to me.”</p>

<p>“Who would tell you?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes one man, sometimes another.”</p>

<p>“Who?” her voice was inexorable.</p>

<p>“Peewee—mostly.”</p>

<p>“Peewee Bangs—your cousin, is he?”</p>

<p>“That’s him.”</p>

<p>“So he would tell you, and you would go to get
it? Where?”</p>

<p>“Out to his place.”</p>

<p>“The Lakeside Hotel?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That was headquarters?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Other folks went there to get whisky?”</p>

<p>“I calc’late so. There’d be a lot of cases. I’d run
my car into the shed, and go in, and when I come
back she’d be packed.”</p>

<p>“What others went there?”</p>

<p>“Different ones. Folks buyin’ private. Peewee
he’d telephone folks he knowed was buyin’ and they’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
drive out and leave their cars a-standin’. When they
come ag’in, there’d be the whisky. They wouldn’t
never see who put it there.”</p>

<p>“Who did you sell to?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to tell.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to tell.”</p>

<p>He moaned, and then, surrendering utterly, gave
her a list of his customers.</p>

<p>“Who did you pay money to?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Peewee.”</p>

<p>“Anybody else?”</p>

<p>“Jest him.”</p>

<p>“Who else did you see at the Lakeside Hotel when
you went to get whisky—who else was selling besides
Peewee?”</p>

<p>“I never saw anybody.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see Deputy Jenney there?”</p>

<p>Lancelot’s face turned more ashen. “I never see
him. I dunno nothin’ about him.”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard he was in it?”</p>

<p>“Jest whispers. But nothin’ I can say.”</p>

<p>“When was the last time you got whisky?”</p>

<p>He gave her the date, which coincided with her
finding of the <i>cache</i> in the woods.</p>

<p>“When do you expect to go again?”</p>

<p>He hesitated. “I—— A feller come to-day. Said I
could run out to-night. Said the’ was a special-sized
shipment comin’....”</p>

<p>“To-night?”</p>

<p>“To-night.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“Every last thing.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. Come with me.”</p>

<p>“Where?... You promised——”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my promise. Just to my office. Please
hurry.”</p>

<p>He followed her with docility, sat by while she
put his confession into type, signed it, and accompanied
her to a notary, where he took his oath to the
truth of the statements therein contained.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Carmel, “I guess you’d better be
moving along toward the distance.”</p>

<p>Lancelot, in abject terror, started for the door, but
Carmel arrested him. “Wait,” she said, and from its
hiding place in her desk she took the match box made
from a brass shell which she had found beside the
whisky <i>cache</i>. She held it before Lancelot’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Whose is this?” she asked.</p>

<p>“B’longs to Deputy Jenney,” he said. “Ol’ Slim
Toomey made it fer him out of a shell.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“HASN’T Mr. Pell come in yet?” Carmel called
to Tubal.</p>

<p>“Hain’t seen hide nor hair of him since last night.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything about staying away?”</p>

<p>“Not a word. Mos’ likely he’s all het up learnin’
the Chinee language backward, or suthin’, and clean
forgot the’ <i>was</i> sich a thing as a paper.”</p>

<p>She thought it queer, but, so occupied was her
mind with the disclosures of Lancelot Bangs and
with the events of last night, that the fact of Evan
Pell’s unexplained absence did not present itself to
her as a thing demanding immediate investigation....
She was wondering what to do with the evidence
in hand. Where to go for more was a question
easy to answer. She possessed a list of names,
any one of whom could be forced to testify, and
nobody could tell which one of them might assay
some pure gold of fact which would lead her to her
destination. She had reached Deputy Jenney. The
match box was damning, yet it must be corroborated
by other evidence.... Past Jenney the trail did
not lead. So far it was a blind alley, blocked by the
bulk of the newly appointed sheriff. In some manner
she must go around or through him to reach Abner
Fownes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>But Abner Fownes was not a man to permit himself
to be reached. The county was his own now,
held in the hollow of his hand. Its law-enforcing
machinery was his private property to turn on or to
turn off as his needs required. Suppose she did find
evidence which would touch him with the pitch of
this affair? Who would make use of the evidence?
Who make the arrest?</p>

<p>Could she get to the sheriff’s office to lay before
Jenney information which would result in his imprisonment
and in Abner Fownes’s destruction?
Suppose she went, as she must go, to the prosecuting
attorney. Suppose warrants were issued? What
then? Jenney’s office must make the service and
the arrests.... It was more thinkable that the
sun would start suddenly to travel from west
to east than that such warrants should become
efficacious.</p>

<p>She called Jared Whitefield on the telephone, desirous
of his advice and assistance in this emergency,
but Jared, she was informed, had gone away from
town. He left suddenly after midnight, and had
stated no destination.... Carmel felt terribly alone.
She felt a need for Evan Pell—some one upon whom
she could depend, some one to talk with, to discuss
this thing with. Whitefield was gone.... Perhaps
Evan had accompanied him. But why? She had
a feeling Jared’s going away was in some manner
connected with the telegram she sent him from the
capital. But why had he taken Evan, and why had
Evan left no word for her.... Her sensation was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
of one suddenly deserted by all the world. She felt
young, inadequate, frightened.</p>

<p>If pride had not held back her tears she would
have cried. It would be a wonderful comfort to
cry—but a young woman engaged on a perilous
enterprise such as hers could not afford the weakness
of tears.... If only Evan Pell were there!</p>

<p>She was arrested by that thought, by the sharpness
of her desire for Evan’s presence. For the first time
she perceived how important was the position he had
assumed in her affairs. She reviewed their association
from its inception, recalled how she had patronized
him, almost despised him. She had pitied him
for his inadequacy, for his dry pedantry.... Step
by step she reviewed the changes which had taken
place in him, dating these changes from that brutal
scene before her door, when Jenney had beaten him
to insensibility.... Her sympathy had commenced
there; admiration had dawned, for it had been given
her to see that a man who could conduct himself as
Evan Pell conducted himself on that day contained in
himself the elements which made up a man. Submerged
they might have been, but they were present—and
not too deep below the surface. She saw again
that unequal fight; perceived the dauntlessness of the
young man; the oaken heart of him which would fight
until it died, fearless, struggling with its last throb to
reach and tear down its enemy.</p>

<p>She saw now how he had struggled to perceive;
how, led by her acid tongue, he had perceived the
futility of his life, and how he had sought to alter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
it. His manner, his very appearance, had changed....
And he loved her! Never before had she given
more than reluctant, pitying thought to his love for
her, but now it assumed other proportions.... She
was aware of wanting him—not as he wanted her—but
of wanting him near her, to lean upon, to feel the
strength of him....</p>

<p>Until he returned she could do nothing!... It
was strange that she, who always had been so self-reliant,
so sure, so ready to act by herself, should
require the upholding of another. She could not
understand it, fancied she had grown weak. She
rather despised herself.... Yet it was a fact. She
did not strive to overthrow it. It was not to be assailed.
She could not go on until Evan Pell returned
to help her!</p>

<p>It was an uneasy, unhappy day, crowded with apprehensions
and questionings.... With events impending,
with peril darkening the immediate future,
she could do nothing but putter with detail. Yet
she welcomed the detail—it took her mind off herself
and her problems.</p>

<p>Noon came, and then suppertime.... It was not
her usual custom to return to the office after supper,
but to-night she did return—to wait for Evan, though
she did not admit it. He might come back, and she
wanted to be there to receive him.</p>

<p>To occupy her mind she took out the books of her
concern and opened them to study progress. The
circulation book came first, and she opened it at the
last entried page. As she spread it before her an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
envelope lay under her eyes, and upon its face, in
Evan Pell’s handwriting, was her name.</p>

<p><i>Miss Carmel Lee!</i></p>

<p>It was the first time she had ever seen her name
in his handwriting, and she gazed at it with a strange,
stifled feeling in her breast.... A letter to her from
Evan Pell, left in this place where she must find it!
She lifted it and held it in her fingers.... Why
had he written? Why left his message in this place?
She drew a sudden breath of fright. Could it be he
had deserted her? Could it be he had found his
position unbearable and, ashamed to face her, had
taken this means of telling her?... She was overmastered
by foreboding, feared to open the letter.</p>

<p>“I must open it,” she said to herself. “I must.”</p>

<p>She compelled her fingers to tear the flap and
to withdraw the letter—even to unfold it so that its
contents were visible. Her eyes saw Evan’s neat,
flawless handwriting, but her mind seemed suddenly
numb, unable to make sense of the symbols set down
upon the paper. She shook her head as if to clear
it of something damp and heavy and obscuring, and
forced herself to read.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear</span>:” (The letter began, and she read over
and over those two intimate words)—“My dear: If
you find this letter—if I have not returned to take it
from the place in which I have hidden it for you, I
am quite sure I shall not see you again. In view of
this possibility I am presuming to say good-by.”
Even now, she saw, something of his pedantic precision
must creep in. It would not have crept in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
she felt sure, had he not been under some strong
emotion, had he not felt the necessity for concealing
his emotion. “I have told you before,” the letter
continued, “that I love you. I have not told you how
I have come willingly, eagerly to love you. You, and
you alone—the fact of your existence, your loveliness—have
made what I fancy are notable changes
in me. I even go so far as to imagine I might, with
time and persistence, become the sort of man who
would be entitled to your friendship, if nothing more.
But, if this letter reaches your eyes, that is, I fear,
no longer possible. I think I have done as I should,
although I have practiced deception. When you remember
I did this because I loved you, I trust you
will find it in your heart to forgive me.</p>

<p>“To-day there came a note to you which I intercepted.
It purported to come from some disgruntled
man, telling you how you could obtain evidence
against these liquor smugglers by going to the Lakeside
Hotel. I rather fancied it was not genuine, and
was meant rather to induce your presence than to
betray confederates. On the other hand, it might be
authentic. I therefore urged you to make the journey
upon which you have just been engaged, and,
because it seemed right to do so, I am going to-night
to test the authenticity of the letter.”</p>

<p>She saw, she understood!</p>

<p>“If it prove to be a lure, such as was used to the
undoing of Sheriff Churchill, there is some small
chance I shall not return. Naturally I shall observe
every caution. But if precautions fail and I do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
return, you will find in a box in my room such evidence
and information as I have collected. It does
not reach the man we wish to reach, but it moves
toward him. I hope you will be able to make use
of it.”</p>

<p>He could write so stiltedly of making use of his
work when he was, open-eyed, going out to walk
into the trap prepared for her!</p>

<p>“Therefore,” the letter concluded, “good-by. My
going will mean little to you; it means little to me,
except the parting from you. If you find time to
think of me at all, I hope you will think of me as
continuing always to love you wherever it may be I
have journeyed. Good-by.”</p>

<p>At the end he had signed his name.</p>

<p>She sat for a moment as though turned to stone.
Her heart was dead, her faculties benumbed....
He was dead! She had found and read the letter,
so he must be dead—vanished as Sheriff Churchill
had vanished, never to be seen again by mortal eye....
And for her! He had gone out calmly, serenely,
to face whatever might beset his path—for
her. He had given his life for her, to preserve her
life!</p>

<p>She sat very still. Her cheeks were white and she
was cold, cold as death. No sound came from her
compressed lips. Dead!... Evan Pell was dead!</p>

<p>Then something not of her own consciousness,
something deep within the machinery of her soul,
moved and controlled her. She acted, but not as one
acts of his own volition, rather as one acts in a mesmeric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
trance.... Her impulse was to go to find
him—to find him, to weep over him ... to avenge
him!</p>

<p>She snatched the receiver from its hook and telephoned
Jared Whitefield again. He would help.
He would know what to do. But Jared Whitefield
had not returned.... She must act alone.</p>

<p>Calmly, like an automaton, she put on her hat, extinguished
the lights, locked the door, and walked
up the street. The direction she took was toward
the Lakeside Hotel. She reached the fringe of the
village which bordered upon the black woods, but
did not pause. Steadily, urged on by some inexorable
force, she continued down that gloomy avenue,
between woodland banks of inky blackness....
She neither hesitated nor paused nor looked behind
her.</p>

<p>Had she looked behind it may have been she would
have seen the shadowy figures of two men who followed,
followed stealthily keeping always a stated
distance, drawing no nearer, flitting at the edge of
the blackness.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABNER FOWNES was apprehensive. Notwithstanding
his success in obtaining the appointment
of Deputy Jenney as sheriff and the utter discomfiture
of Carmel Lee, uneasiness possessed him.
He felt driven, pursued. Events marshaled their
forces against him with a sort of sinister inexorability.
Being a man of superior intelligence, he
was able to see the intricacies and dangers of his
position more surely than a lesser man could have
done; and as he sat in the train on his return to
Gibeon he took stock of himself, reviewed the past,
and prepared himself for the future.</p>

<p>To see Carmel Lee in the capital was a shock. He
had not expected to see her, but, on the contrary, was
awaiting reports on the success of his plan to eliminate
her.... It was his first piece of bad luck; the
first time things had worked out crookedly for him,
and it alarmed him. Every successful man believes
in his luck, and now Fownes was apprehensive lest
luck had deserted him.</p>

<p>That Carmel had accused him of crimes in the
Governor’s presence did not alarm him especially—except
for this: that anybody would dare to speak
such words concerning him. It was not the thing
uttered, the person who listened, but that fact of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
utterance. Hitherto people had been afraid of him,
but this girl was unafraid.... It must mean something,
some turning of the tide. He felt a trembling
of his foundations.</p>

<p>It is at such a moment that a man of Fownes’s type
is most to be feared. He was vain; his position in the
world meant more to him than any other consideration.
To have that position assailed, to face the possibility
of being thrust from his eminence in ignominy,
was an eventuality he would avert by
any means within reach of his hand. Indeed, he
had already reached for the weapon—but luck had
intervened.</p>

<p>He felt stifled by adversities. Never before had
he doubted his ability to come through this emergency
with satisfaction to himself. He had believed
in himself. Even when he had been forced outside
the law to protect his position, he regarded it only
as a makeshift, undesirable, perhaps, but necessary
to him, and therefore permissible. It had been his
intention to stabilize his business again, and then to
withdraw to lawful practices and a life of conscious
rectitude.... But adversities, of late, erected themselves
with such rapidity! Money was required of
him when he had hoped promises to pay would have
sufficed; he was rushed into expedients endangering
the whole edifice of his life. So far there had been
no slip, but he was intelligent enough to perceive there
might be a slip....</p>

<p>A slip would not be so dangerous if it were not
that Carmel Lee were standing, watching always,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
ready to pounce upon any mishap. She and that professor
fellow!... Evan Pell, with a natural adaptability
for snooping. Fownes had him dismissed
from the schools because he snooped into his affairs....
It was therefore essential that both these individuals
should be rendered no longer a menace.</p>

<p>There was Sheriff Churchill.... Well, there
was something which could never be brought home
to him. It had been well and successfully managed....
But he wanted no more of that—unless absolute
necessity demanded.</p>

<p>If he could have married the girl! That would
have shut her mouth and at the same time have given
him a desirable wife—one whom he would have
taken pride in introducing into such functions as that
which he had attended at the capital.... But he
could not marry her.... She could be made to disappear
as Churchill had disappeared—but three disappearances
would be rather too many. If three persons
vanished, folks would regard it as rather more
than a coincidence. Therefore Carmel and Pell would
not vanish unless all other expedients failed.</p>

<p>If, however, he could keep his word to her; if he
could smash her life, place her in a position which
would overwhelm her, destroy her self-respect, send
her crashing down in some infamous way—that
would serve so much better.... He had found the
way to do it, but luck intervened. Instead of being
where he intended she should be, Carmel appeared
safely in the capital—and multiplied the danger she
represented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>He wondered if the whole scheme had gone awry.
There was no word from Jenney. Nothing as to
the whereabouts of Evan Pell. Pell was of importance
in Fownes’s plan—indispensable to it. Deputy
Jenney was indispensable to it, as were Peewee Bangs
and his Lakeside Hotel.... The plan had been so
simple and would have been so effective.</p>

<p>If Carmel had not gone to the capital, but, instead,
had adventured to the Lakeside Hotel to investigate
the mysterious note—the rest was simple. She
would have been followed; Pell would have been
followed. To seize and imprison the pair in a room
in the unsavory Lakeside Hotel would have been a
mere matter of a couple of strong arms.... To imprison
them in the same room! Following that, the
room being set according to the demands of the
occasion, the hotel would have been raided. Deputy
Jenney, that public-spirited official, would have conducted
the raid.... The posse would have found
Carmel and Pell in their room, surrounded by evidences
of such orgies as the Lakeside was famous
for. They would have been arrested together, taken
to the jail.... That was all, but it would have
sufficed. Never again could Carmel hold up her
head; she would be destroyed utterly, driven out of
Gibeon, made forever ineffective. It was really better
than killing her outright....</p>

<p>Abner alighted at Gibeon’s depot and was driven
to his office. He summoned Jenney, who came with
alacrity.</p>

<p>“Well, Sheriff?” said Abner, jocularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“Much obleeged,” said Jenney.</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“The girl went off some’eres in Whitefield’s auto.
Didn’t git back till some time in the mornin’....
But we got <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“We got him—the perfessor.”</p>

<p>Fownes considered that. They had the professor—but
he was worse than useless alone, he was a
menace. So long as Carmel Lee was at liberty, Evan
Pell, as a prisoner, was a constant danger. No telling
what the girl would do. Besides, she was allied
with Jared Whitefield—and Whitefield was no man
to overlook. Abner scowled.</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Out to Peewee’s.”</p>

<p>“He went out there?”</p>

<p>“Came spyin’ around. Kind of clever about it,
too. We almost missed him.... But we didn’t?”</p>

<p>“Is he hurt?”</p>

<p>“Mussed up some. No hurt to speak of.”</p>

<p>“And to-night the big shipment comes in.”</p>

<p>“Your orders.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get the girl,” Abner said. “Have
her watched every instant. Have everything in
readiness. If she puts her foot in a spot where you
and your men can take her, don’t lose a minute.”
His voice lifted with excitement. “Get her. Do you
hear?... Get her!”</p>

<p>“Where’s Whitefield?” Jenney said.</p>

<p>“How should I know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“I <i>want</i> to know.... You can’t handle him like
you can this girl. He’s gone some’eres, and I want
to know where and why.”</p>

<p>Fownes scowled, but made no rejoinder.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the way things is goin’,” Jenney said,
sulkily. “I feel like I was gittin’ cornered.”</p>

<p>“You’re sheriff, aren’t you? Who’ll corner you.
You’re frightened, Jenney. Men who get frightened
aren’t useful to me. Now, get out of here. You
know what you’ve got to do. Do it.”</p>

<p>“Town meetin’ to-morrer. I got to be there.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be some place beside at a town meeting,
Sheriff, if that girl is allowed to run around another
twenty-four hours.... Git!”</p>

<p>Jenney went out slowly, much perturbed. He
was a man of consequence to-day. Yesterday
he had been nobody but Deputy Jenney, a political
henchman, a nobody. To-day his life’s ambition
was realized; he bestrode the pinnacle of his
hopes. He had achieved the position toward
which he had labored and schemed for a dozen
years. What happened to Deputy Jenney was
more or less inconsequential. As Deputy Jenney
he dared take chances—for money or for advancement.
But as Sheriff Jenney!... That was
a different matter. Very gladly, now, would he
have extricated himself from his entanglements
and conducted himself as, according to his system
of ethics, a man of mark should do. Why, he
was the biggest man in the county—with a salary
and fees and patronage!... Well, he was in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
and he must protect himself.... Damn Fownes,
anyhow.</p>

<p>He did not pause to consider that without Fownes
and his connection with the whisky-smuggling industry
he would never have become sheriff.... That
was forgotten. Like many men, he ignored the ladder
by which he had climbed. In this case, however,
the ladder declined to ignore him. If Jenney had
ever heard the word <i>sardonic</i> he would have made
telling use of it now.... How many men are trammeled
by inadequate vocabularies!</p>

<p>His first step was cautiously to call Peewee Bangs
by telephone, and in his conversation Jenney disclosed
a kind of apt and helpful humor of which
few would have accused him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Peewee!” he said. “That you?”</p>

<p>“It’s me, Sheriff.”</p>

<p>“H’m!... Got that bundle of school books
safe?” Jenney chuckled a little at this. He considered
it very acute indeed—to describe Evan Pell
as a bundle of school books.</p>

<p>“Got ’em tight,” said Peewee. “And the bookcase
door’s locked. Was jest lookin’ ’em over.
Gittin’ me an eddication, so to say.”</p>

<p>“Was the bindin’s injured much?”</p>

<p>“Not to speak of. One of the covers was tore
off, but it kin be patched on ag’in with glue, seems
as though. Hain’t no pages tore.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad we got to keep ’em alone,” said
Jenney. “I’m figgerin’ on addin’ to the lib’rary....
Durin’ the day or night. You be ready to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
care of another volume. ’Tain’t so educational as
the other figgers to be, but it’s put up in a dum sight
pertier cover.”</p>

<p>“I git you,” said Peewee. “The librarian’ll be on
the job. Got any idee what hour you’ll deliver?”</p>

<p>“May be any hour. Sit tight, and don’t on no account
lose what we got. What we want, Peewee, is
a nice, complete eddication, and we can’t git it ’less
we have both them books to study side by side.”</p>

<p>“Uh huh.... An’ say, Sheriff, the pantry’s all
ready fer that shipment of catchup. Quite a consignment,
eh? Never had so much catchup in the
house before.”</p>

<p>“Too doggone much. I was ag’in it.... But
it’s comin’, and we got to look out f’r it.”</p>

<p>“Five loads,” said Peewee.</p>

<p>“Comin’ different roads.”</p>

<p>“Mebby ye kin dispose of some of it if the order’s
too big fer your own use.”</p>

<p>“I kind of arranged to,” said Peewee. “Everythin’s
all right <i>this</i> end.”</p>

<p>“For Gawd’s sake,” said Jenney, betraying for a
moment his anxiety, “don’t let nothin’ slip.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tend to my end if you tend to your’n,” snapped
Mr. Bangs.</p>

<p>Directly following this conversation, Jenney detailed
two trustworthy gentlemen to keep an eye on
Carmel Lee. It was pointed out to them to be their
duty not to lose sight of her an instant, and, on pain
of certain severe penalties, to let no opportunity slip
to induce her to join Evan Pell at the Lakeside Hotel....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
It was these two gentlemen who, gratefully,
saw her take her way out of town in the late evening,
following the very road they would have chosen
for her. They made sure she was alone, that no one
was coming after her, and then took to themselves
the office of escort. Quite gleefully they followed
her, as she, unconscious of their presence, trudged
toward the hotel. She was so thoughtful as to save
them even the small trouble of transporting her.</p>

<p>“Like the feller that let the bear chase him into
camp so’s he could shoot his meat nigh home,” whispered
one of the gentlemen.</p>

<p>Carmel proceeded rapidly; too rapidly for such
precautions as she should have observed. She was
without plan; her mind was in such chaos as to
render planning futile. Instinct alone was not inactive....
No matter how shaken the objective
faculties may be, those superior subjective intuitions
and inhibitions and urgings never sleep. Their business
is so largely with the preservation of the body
which they inhabit that they dare not sleep.</p>

<p>Quite without thinking; without a clear idea why
she did so, Carmel turned off the road and took to
the woods. Self-preservation was at work. Instinct
was in control.... The gentlemen behind quickened
their pace, disgruntled at this lack of consideration
on the part of their quarry.... It was with some
difficulty they found the place where she entered
the woods.... Carmel herself had vanished utterly.
In that black maze, a tangle of slashings, a huddle of
close-growing young spruce, it was impossible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
descry her, to tell in which direction she had turned.
Nor did they dare make use of a flashlight in an
effort to follow her trail. However, they must
needs do something, so, keeping the general direction
of the hotel, paralleling the road, they proceeded
slowly, baffled, but hopeful....</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is not easy for one unaccustomed to the woods
to remain undeviatingly upon his course even in
the daytime; at night it can be accomplished only by
a miracle. Carmel, in a state of agitation which was
not distant from hysteria, had paused neither to
consider nor to take her bearings. Of herself she
was utterly careless. The only thought in her mind
was to reach, and in some manner to give aid to,
Evan Pell if he remained alive. Instinct alone
moved her to turn off the road and seek the protection
of the forest. Once engulfed in its blackness
she stumbled alone, tripping, falling, turning, twisting—hurrying,
always hurrying.... The physical
exertion cleared her brain, reduced her to something
like rationality.</p>

<p>She paused, leaned panting against the bole of a
great beech ... and discovered she was lost.</p>

<p>The evening had been cloudy, but now the clouds
were being dissipated by an easterly breeze—a chilly
breeze—and from time to time the moon peered
through to turn the blackness of the woods into a
cavern, dim-lit, filled with moving, grotesque alarming
shadows. The shape of fear lurks always in
the forest. It hides behind every tree, crouches in
every thicket, ready to leap out upon the back of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
him who shall for an instant lay aside the protective
armor of his presence of mind. The weapon of fear
is panic.... Fear perches upon the shoulder, whispering:
“You are lost. You know not which way
to go.... You have lost your way.” Then there
arises in the heart and brain of the victim a sensation
so horrible that words cannot describe it; it can be
realized only by those who have experienced it. It
is a combination of emotions and fears, comparable
to nothing.... It is a living, clutching, torturing
horror. First comes apprehension, then bewilderment.
A frenzied effort to discover some landmark,
to tear from the forest the secret of the points of
the compass. One determines to sit calmly and reflect;
to proceed coolly.... The thing is impossible.
One sits while the watch ticks fifty times, and is sure
he has rested for hours. He arises, takes two steps
with studied deliberation, and finds he is running,
bursting through slashings and underbrush in unreasoning
frenzy. And frenzy thrives upon itself.
One wishes to shout, to scream.... Fear chokes
him, engulfs him. Reason deserts utterly, and there
remains nothing but horror, panic....</p>

<p>Carmel experienced this and more. Throbbing,
rending terror was hers, yet, even at the height of
her panic, there lay beneath it, making it more horrible,
her fear for Evan Pell. She uttered his name.
Sobbing, she called to him—and always, always she
struggled forward under the urge of panic. Even
the little nickel-plated electric flash in her pocket was
forgotten. That would have been something—light!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
It would have been a comfort, a hope.... How
long she ran and fell, picked herself up to stagger
onward to another fall, she did not know. For
minutes the woods were an impenetrable gulf of
blackness; then the moon would emerge to permit
its eerie light to trickle through the interlacing
foliage, and to paint grotesque patterns upon the
ground beneath her feet. Threatening caverns
loomed; mysterious sounds assailed her.... She
was sobbing, crying Evan Pell’s name. And then—with
startling suddenness—the woods ceased to be,
and light was.... The heavens were clean swept of
clouds, and the moon, round and full, poured down
the soft silver of its radiance—a radiance reflected,
mirrored, turned to brighter silver by the rippled
waters of the lake.... Carmel sank in a pitiful
little heap and cried—they were tears of relief. She
had reached the lake.</p>

<p>It was possible to reason now. She had turned
from the road to the right. The Lakeside Hotel was
to the left of the road, and, therefore, she had but
to skirt the shore of the lake, traveling to leftward,
and she must reach her destination.</p>

<p>She arose, composed herself, and, womanlike, arranged
her hat and hair. Then, keeping close to
the water for fear she might again become bewildered
and so lose this sure guide, she started again toward
her objective.</p>

<p>As she turned a jutting point of land she saw, a
quarter of a mile distant, the not numerous lights
which indicated the presence of Bangs’s ill-reputed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
hostelry. This sure realization of the nearness of
danger awakened caution. It awakened, too, a sense
of her futility. Now that she was where something
must be done, what was there possible for her to do?
What did she mean to do?... She could not answer,
but, being an opportunist, she told herself that
events should mold her actions; that some course
would open before her when need for it became
imminent.</p>

<p>Small things she noted—inconsequential things.
The lake had fallen during the dry weather. She
noted that. It had receded to leave at its edge a
ribbon of mud, sometimes two feet, sometimes six
feet wide.... This was one of those inconsequential,
extraneous facts which appear so sharply
and demand attention when the mind is otherwise
vitally occupied.... She noted the thick-growing
pickerel grass growing straight and slender and
thrusting its spears upward through the scarcely
agitated water. It was lovely in the moonlight....
She noted the paths upon the water, paths which
began without reason and wound off to no destination....
Her eyes were busy, strangely busy, photographically
occupied. No detail of that nocturne
but would be printed indelibly upon the retina of
her brain so long as she should live.... Details,
details, details!</p>

<p>Then she stopped! Her hand flew to her breast
with sudden gesture and clutched the bosom of her
waist. She started back, trembling.... Was that
a log lying half upon the muddy ribbon, half submerged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
in the receded waters of the lake? She
hoped it was a log, but there was something—<i>something</i>
which arrested her, compelled her.... If it
were a log it was such a log as she never had seen before....
It had not a look of hard solidity, but
rather of awful limpness, of softness. It sprawled
grotesquely. It was still, frightfully still.... She
gathered her courage to approach; stood upon the
grassy shelf above this shape which might have been
a log but seemed not to be a log, and bent to peer
downward upon it....</p>

<p>She thought she screamed, but she did not. No
sound issued from her throat, although her lips
opened.... She fell back, covering her face....
The log was no log; it was no twisted, grotesque
drift wood.... It was the body of a man, the limbs
of a man fearfully extended....</p>

<p>Carmel felt ill, dizzy. She struggled against
faintness. Then the searing, unbearable thought—was
it Evan?... She must know, she must
determine....</p>

<p>Alone with the thing beneath her, with the fearsome
woods behind her, with the lonely, coldly glittering
lake before her, it was almost beyond belief
that she should find the courage to determine....
Something within her, something stronger than horror,
than terror, laid its hand upon her and compelled
her. She could not, dared not, believe it was Evan
Pell.</p>

<p>From her pocket she drew the little, nickel-plated
flashlight and pressed its button. Then, covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
her eyes, she forced herself inch by inch to approach
the lip of the grassy shelf.... She could not look,
but she must look.... First she pointed the beam
of the light downward, her eyes tight-closed. Clenching
her fist, biting her lips, she put every atom of
strength in her body to the task of forcing the lids
of her eyes to open—and she looked, looked full
upon the awful thing at her feet.</p>

<p>For an instant sickness, frightful repulsion, horror,
was held at bay by relief.... It was not Evan.
Those soggy garments were not his; that bulk was
not his.... She dared to look again, and let none
decry the courage required to perform this act....
It was a terrible thing to see.... Her eyes dared
not remain upon the awful, bearded face. They
swept downward to where the coat, lying open, disclosed
the shirt.... Upon the left bosom of the
shirt was a metal shape. Carmel stared at it—and
stared.... It was a star, no longer bright and
glittering, but unmistakably a star....</p>

<p>Then, instantly, Carmel Lee knew what had become
of Sheriff Churchill....</p>

<p>It was enough; she was required to look no more....
The spot was accursed, unendurable, and she fled
from it; fled toward the lights of the Lakeside Hotel....
That they were lights of which she could not
beg shelter she did not think; that she was safer
with the thing which the lake had given up she did
not consider. That the living to whom she fled were
more frightful than the dead whom she deserted
was not for her to believe in that moment. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
must have light; she must feel the presence of human
beings, hear human voices—it mattered not whose
they were.</p>

<p>Presently, forcing her way through a last obstruction
of baby spruces, she reached the thoroughfare,
and there, hidden by the undergrowth, she stood,
looking for the first time upon this group of buildings
so notorious in the county, so important in her
own affairs. The hotel itself, a structure of frame
and shingles, stretched along the lake—a long, low,
squatting, sinister building. A broad piazza stretched
from end to end, and from its steps a walk led down
to a wharf jutting into the water. To the rear were
barns and sheds and an inclosure hidden from the
eye by a high lattice—a typical roadhouse of the least
desirable class.... She searched such of its windows
as were lighted. Human figures moved to and
fro in the room which must have been the dining
room. An orchestra played....</p>

<p>She had been on the spot but a moment when she
heard the approaching engine of some motor vehicle.
She waited. A huge truck, loaded high and covered
with a tarpaulin, drew up to the gate at the rear of
the hotel. Its horn demanded admittance, the gate
opened and it rolled in.... She waited, uncertain.
Another truck appeared—high loaded as the first—and
was admitted.... Then, in quick succession,
three others.... Five trucks loaded to capacity—and
Carmel knew well what was their load!...
Contraband!... Its value to be counted not by
thousands of dollars, but by tens of thousands!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>The facts were hers now, but what was she to do
with them? To whom report them?... And
there was Evan. What mattered contraband whisky
when his fate was in doubt? Evan Pell came first—she
realized now that he came first, before everything,
before herself!... She asked no questions,
but accepted the fact.</p>

<p>Keeping to the roadside in the shadows, she picked
her way along for a couple of hundred feet, meaning
to cross the road and to make her way to the
rear of the hotel’s inclosure. There must be some
opening through which she might observe what
passed and so make some discovery which might
be of use to her in her need.... She paused, undecided,
determined a sudden, quick crossing would
be safest, and, lifting her skirts, ran out upon the
roadway....</p>

<p>There was a shout, a rush of feet. She felt ungentle
hands, and, dropping such inhibitions as
generations of civilization had imposed upon her,
Carmel fought like a wildcat, twisting, scratching,
tearing.... She was crushed, smothered. Her
arms were twisted behind her, a cloth jerked roughly
over her face, and she felt herself lifted in powerful
arms.... They carried her to some door, for she
heard them rap for admission.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” said a voice.</p>

<p>“Fetch Peewee,” said one of her captors. “Quick.”
Then came a short wait, and she heard Peewee
Bangs’s nasal voice. “What’s up?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“We got her. What’ll we do with her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“Fetch her in,” said Peewee. “Up the back stairs.
I’ll show ye the way.”</p>

<p>Carmel, not struggling now, was carried up a narrow
flight of steps; she heard a key turn in a lock.
Then she was thrust into a room, pushed so that she
stumbled and went to her knees. The door slammed
behind her and was locked again.... She got to
her feet, trembling, wavering, snatched the cloth
from her face, and looked before her.... There, in
the dim light, she saw a man. He stood startled,
staring with unbelieving eyes.</p>

<p>“Evan!...” she cried. “Evan!... Thank
God you’re alive.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HE did not come toward her; did not move from
his place, and then she saw that he stood only
by clinging to the back of a chair.... He leaned
forward and stared at her through eyes drawn by
pain.</p>

<p>“You’re hurt!... They’ve hurt you!” she cried.</p>

<p>“My ankle only,” he said. “Sprained, I fancy.”
Then, “What are you doing here?” He spoke almost
petulantly as one would speak to a naughty
child who turns up in some embarrassing spot.</p>

<p>“I—I found your letter,” she said.</p>

<p>“My letter?... Ah yes, my letter.... Then
I—I brought you into this trap.”</p>

<p>“No.... Evan, it was a fine thing you did. For
me. You—have come to <i>this</i> for me.”</p>

<p>“It was an exceedingly unintelligent thing—writing
that letter.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Evan.... As long as I live I shall be
glad you wrote it. I am glad, glad ... to know
there is a man capable of—of sacrificing and—maybe
dying for——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Evan. “It was a trap, of course.
And I thought my mental caliber was rather larger
than that of these people. Very humiliating.” He
frowned at her. “Why did you have to come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“You ask that?”</p>

<p>“I most certainly do ask it. You had no business
to come. Wasn’t my failure to return a sufficient
warning?... Why did you take this foolish risk?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know?”</p>

<p>“I want to know,” he said with the severity of a
schoolmaster cross-questioning a refractory pupil.</p>

<p>“Must I tell?”</p>

<p>“You must.” Carmel was almost able to see the
humor of it. A pathetic shadow of a smile lighted
her face.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to—to tell it this way,” she said.
“I——”</p>

<p>“Will you be so good as to give me a direct answer?
Why did you come rushing here—headlong—when
you knew perfectly well——” He paused
and his severe eyes accused her.</p>

<p>She moved a step closer; her hands fluttered up
from her side and dropped again; she bit her
lip. “Because,” she said, in the lowest of voices, “I
love you—and—and where you were I—wanted
to be.”</p>

<p>The chair which supported Evan tipped forward
and clattered again into place. He stared at her as
if she were some very strange laboratory specimen
indeed, and then said in his most insistently didactic
voice, punctuating his words with a waggling forefinger,
“You don’t mean to stand there—and to tell
<i>me</i>—that you love <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>Carmel gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“That,” he said, “is beside the question.... You
... <i>you</i> ... love <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you,” he said. “You couldn’t.
Nobody could.... I’ve been studying this—er—matter
of love, and I am assured of my complete
unfitness to arouse such an emotion.”</p>

<p>Her heart misgave her. “Evan—you—you love
me?”</p>

<p>“I do,” he said, emphatically. “Most assuredly I
do, but——”</p>

<p>“Then it’s all right,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s not all right.... I don’t in the least believe
you—er—reciprocate my feeling for you....
You are—er—deceiving me for some reason.”</p>

<p>“Evan—please—oh——” Her lips quivered and
her voice became tearful. “You—you’re making it—terribly
hard. Girls don’t usually have to—to argue
with men to—to make them believe they love
them.... You—you’re hurting me.”</p>

<p>“I—er—have no intention of doing so. In fact
I—I would not hurt you for—anything in the world....
As a matter of—of fact, I want to—prevent
you from being hurt....” At this point he bogged
down, the wheels of his conversation mired, and
progress ceased.</p>

<p>“Then,” demanded Carmel, “why do you make me
do it?”</p>

<p>“Do what?”</p>

<p>“Propose to you, Evan Pell. It’s not my place.
I have to do all the courting.... If you—you want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
me, why don’t you say so—and—and ask me to
marry you?”</p>

<p>“You—you’d marry <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.... Not—I won’t say another
word until you’ve asked me—as—as a man should.”</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath and, bending forward,
searched her face with hungry eyes. What he saw
must have satisfied him, given him confidence, for
he threw back his shoulders. “I can’t come to you,”
he said, gently. “I want to come to you. I want
to be close to you, and to tell you how I love you—how
my love for you has changed my life.... I—my
manner—it was because I couldn’t believe—because
the idea that you—you could ever see anything
in me to—to admire—was so new. I never
believed you—could.... I—was satisfied to love
you. But—Carmel—if you can—if some miracle
has made you care for a poor creature like me—I
shall—Oh, my dear!—it will make a new world,
a wonderful and beautiful world.... I—I can’t
come to you. Will you—come to me?”</p>

<p>She drew closer slowly, almost reluctantly, and
stood before him. His grave, starving eyes looked
long into hers.</p>

<p>“My—my dear!” he said, huskily, and kneeling
upon the chair with his sound leg—in order to release
his arms for more essential purposes, he held
them out to her....</p>

<p>“Your arms are strong,” she said presently. “I
had no idea.... You are very strong.”</p>

<p>“I—exercise with a rowing machine,” he said....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
And then: “Now we must think.... I didn’t
much care—before. Now I have something to live
for.”</p>

<p>His words brought Carmel back to the realities,
to the prison room in which they were locked, and
to the men below stairs who had made them prisoners
for their sinister purposes.</p>

<p>“I have found Sheriff Churchill,” she said.</p>

<p>“His body?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “And this house is full of contraband
liquor. Five big trucks—loaded....”</p>

<p>“All of which is useless information to us here.”</p>

<p>“What—do you think they will do with us?”</p>

<p>Evan turned away his head and made no answer.</p>

<p>Carmel clutched his arm. “Oh, they wouldn’t....
They couldn’t.... Not now. Nothing can
happen to us now.”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” he said, gravely, “we have this. It
is something.”</p>

<p>“But I want more. I want happiness—alive with
you.... Oh, we must do something—something.”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said. “Please—er—be calm. I
will see what is to be done.”</p>

<p>He sank into the chair, and she sat close beside
him, clinging to his hand. Neither spoke.... At
the sound of footsteps in the hall outside their heads
lifted and their eyes fastened upon the door. A key
grated in the lock and the door swung inward, permitting
Peewee Bangs to enter. He stood grinning
at them—the grin distorting his pinched, hunchback’s
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Well,” he said, “here you be—both of ye. How
d’ye like the accommodations?”</p>

<p>Peewee evidently came to talk, not to be talked to,
for he did not wait for an answer.</p>

<p>“Folks that go meddlin’ in other folkses’ business
ought to be more careful,” he said. “But numbers
hain’t.... Now you was gittin’ to be a dummed
nuisance. We’ve talked about you consid’able....
And say, we fixed it so’s you hain’t goin’ to be
missed for a day or so. Uh huh. Had a feller telephone
from the capital sayin’ you was back there
on business.”</p>

<p>“What—are you going to do with us?” Carmel
asked.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ painful—quite likely. If you was to turn
up missin’ that ’u’d make too many missin’ folks....
So you hain’t a-goin’ to. Nope. We calc’late
on havin’ you found—public like. Sure thing. Sheriff’s
goin’ to find ye.”</p>

<p>“Sheriff Jenney?”</p>

<p>“That’s him.... We’re goin’ to kind of arrange
this room a little—like you ’n’ that teacher feller’d
been havin’ a nice leetle party here. Understand?...
Plenty to drink and sich.” He drew his head
back upon his distorted shoulders and looked up at
them with eyes in which burned the fire of pure
malice. Carmel turned away from him to determine
from Evan’s face if he understood Bangs’s meaning.
It was clear he did not.</p>

<p>“Don’t git the idea, eh?” Peewee asked, with evident
enjoyment. “Wa-al, since we got a good sheriff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
and one that kin be depended on, things is different
here. He’s all for upholdin’ the law, and he aims
to make an example out of me.”</p>

<p>“Sheriff Jenney make an example of <i>you</i>!” Carmel
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Funny, hain’t it? But that’s the notion. You
bet you.... Goin’ to kind of raid my hotel, like
you might say, and git evidence ag’in’ me. Dunno’s
he’ll find much. More’n likely he won’t.... But
he’ll find you two folks—he’ll come rampagin’ in here
and find you together as cozy as bugs in a rug.”
Peewee stopped to laugh with keen enjoyment of
the humorous situation he described. “He’ll find
you folks here, and he’ll find how you been together
to-night and all day to-morrer.... And plenty
of refreshments a-layin’ around handy. Reg’lar
party.”</p>

<p>“You mean Sheriff Jenney will come to this hotel—officially—and
find Mr. Pell and myself in this
room?”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket.”</p>

<p>“Why—why—he’d have to let us go.”</p>

<p>“Sooner or later,” said Peewee. “Fust he’d take
you to the jail and lock you up—disorderly persons
or some sich charge. Drinkin’ and carousin’ in my
hotel!... Course he’ll have to let you go—sometime.
Maybe after the jedge gives you thirty days
in the calaboose.”</p>

<p>“Um!... I think I comprehend,” said Evan,
slowly. “I—In fact, I am sure I comprehend....
Sheriff Jenney did not originate this plan, I am sure....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Nor yourself. It required a certain modicum
of intelligence.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no matter who thought it up—it’s
thought,” said Peewee, “and when the town of
Gibeon comes to know all the facts—why, I don’t
figger you two’ll be in a position to do nobody much
harm.... Folks hain’t apt to believe you like you
was the Bible. Kind of hidebound, them Gibeon
people. Sh’u’dn’t be s’prised if they give you a ride
out of town on a rail.”</p>

<p>“Nobody would believe it. We would tell everyone
how we came to be here.” This from Carmel.</p>

<p>“We’re willin’ to take that chance,” grinned Peewee.
“Seems like a certain party’s got a grudge
ag’in’ you, miss, and he allus pays off his grudges.”</p>

<p>“As he paid off Sheriff Churchill,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“Killin’,” said Peewee, sententiously, “is quick.
This here’ll last you a lifetime. You’ll allus be
knowed as the gal that was arrested with a man in
the Lakeside Hotel....”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and walked to the door;
there he paused to grin at them maliciously before he
disappeared, locking the door after him with elaborate
care.</p>

<p>“They—nobody would believe,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, indeed, I may say I am certain,
everybody would believe,” said Evan. “I have seen
the reactions of Gibeon to affairs of this sort. Gibeon
loves to believe the worst.”</p>

<p>“Then——”</p>

<p>“We would have to go away,” said Evan, gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“But—but the story would follow us.”</p>

<p>“Such stories always follow.”</p>

<p>Carmel studied his face. It was Evan Pell’s face,
but for the first time she saw how different it was
from the pedant’s face, the schoolmaster’s face, he
had worn when first she met him. The spectacles
were gone; the dissatisfied, supercilious expression
was gone, and, in its place, she perceived something
stronger, infinitely more desirable. She saw strength,
courage, sympathy, understanding. She saw what
gave her hope even in this, her blackest hour. If
the worst came to the worst she had found a man
upon whom to rely, a man who would stand by her
to the end and uphold her and protect her and love
her.</p>

<p>Yet—she closed her eyes to shut out the imagined
scenes—to be branded as a woman who could accompany
a man to such a resort as the Lakeside, and to
remain with him there for days and nights—carousing!...
She knew how she regarded women who
were guilty of such sordid affairs. Other women
would look at her as she looked at them, would draw
away their skirts when she passed, would peer at her
with hard, hostile, sneering eyes.... That would be
her life thenceforward—the life of an outcast, of a
woman detected in sin.... It would be horrible,
unspeakably horrible—unbearable. She had valued
herself so highly, had, without giving it conscious
thought, felt herself to be so removed from such
affairs as quite to dwell upon a planet where they
could not exist. She had been proud without knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
she was proud.... It had not been so much a sensation
of purity, a consciousness of purity, as a sureness
in herself, a certainty that evil could not approach
her.... And now....</p>

<p>“Evan—Evan—I am frightened,” she said.</p>

<p>“If only you had not come,” he answered.</p>

<p>“But I am here—I am glad I am here—with you.”</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand toward her and she laid
her hand in the clasp of his fingers.</p>

<p>“We have until to-morrow night,” he said.
“Twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Empires have fallen in twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“Maybe—some one will come to look for us.”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “They will have taken care of
that.”</p>

<p>“Then you—think there is no chance.”</p>

<p>“I—— Carmel dear, the chance is slight. I must
admit the chance is slight. But with twenty-four
hours.... If——” His eyes traveled about the
skimpily furnished room, searching for something,
searching for it vainly. “If I could walk,” he said.
“I’m—almost helpless.”</p>

<p>She went to him, trembling, the horror of the
future eating into her as if it were an acid-coated
mantle. “I—I won’t be able to live,” she said.</p>

<p>He did not answer, for his eyes were fixed on the
door which led, not into the hall, but into an adjoining
bedroom. They rested upon its white doorknob
as if hypnotized.</p>

<p>“Will you help me to that door?” he asked. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
push the chair along. You—can you keep me from
falling?”</p>

<p>Slowly, not without twinges of hot pain in his
injured ankle, they reached the door. Evan felt in
his pocket for his penknife, and with it set about
loosening the screw which held the knob in place.
Twice he broke the blade of his knife, but at last he
managed the thing. The white doorknob rested in
his hand.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, “that is something.”</p>

<p>“What?... I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>He sat in the chair, removed the shoe from his
sound foot and then the sock. He did this slowly,
methodically, and as methodically replaced the shoe
on his sockless foot. Then he lifted from the floor
the stocking and dropped into it the doorknob. It
fitted snugly into the toe.</p>

<p>“Er—I have read of such things,” he said. He
grasped the sock by the top and whirled it about his
head. “Mechanics,” said he, “teach us that a blow
delivered with such an implement is many times more
efficacious than a blow delivered with the—er—solid
object held directly in the hand....”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">“I HAVE come to the conclusion,” said Evan
Pell, “that every man, no matter what his vocation,
should be a man of action. That is to say,
he should devote some attention and practice to
those muscular and mental activities which will
serve him should some unexpected emergency arise.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Carmel.... “Yes.”</p>

<p>“I find myself with little or no equipment for
strenuous adventure. This, we must admit, proves
itself to be a serious oversight.”</p>

<p>“Do you know how long we have been shut in
this room?” Carmel demanded.</p>

<p>“I do. You were—er—propelled into this place
at approximately ten-thirty last night. It is now
five o’clock to-day. Eighteen hours and a half.”</p>

<p>“Nothing has happened—nothing!... We’ve
been fed like animals in a zoo.... I dozed fitfully
during the night. We’ve talked and talked, and
waited—waited.... This waiting! Evan, I—it’s
the waiting which is so terrible.”</p>

<p>“There are,” said Evan, with self-accusation in
his voice, “men who would escape from this place.
They would do it with seeming ease. Undoubtedly
there is a certain technique, but I do not possess it.
I—er—on an occasion I attended a showing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
motion pictures. There was an individual who—without
the least apparent difficulty, accomplished
things to which escape from this room would be
mere child’s play.”</p>

<p>“To-night,” said Carmel, “the sheriff will come
to this hotel, and find us here.”</p>

<p>“What must you think of me?” Evan said, desperately.
He turned in his chair and stared through
the window toward the woods which surrounded
the hotel upon three sides, his shoulders drooping
with humiliation. Carmel was at his side in an instant,
her hands upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Evan!... Evan! You must not accuse yourself.
No man could do anything. You have done
all—more than all—any man could do.... We—whatever
comes, we shall face it together.... I—I
shall always be proud of you.”</p>

<p>“I—I want you to be proud of me. I—the man
will be here with our food in half an hour....
Would you mind standing at some distance?”</p>

<p>She withdrew, puzzled. Evan drew from his
pocket the stocking with the doorknob in its toe
and studied it severely. “This,” said he, “is our
sole reliance. It has a most unpromising look. I
have never seen an implement less calculated to
arouse hope.”</p>

<p>He edged his chair closer to the bed, grasped the
top of the sock, and scowled at a spot on the coverlid.
He shook his head, reached for his handkerchief,
and, folding it neatly, laid it upon the spot
at which he had scowled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“A—er—target,” he explained.</p>

<p>Then, drawing back his arm, he brought down
the improvised slung-shot with a thud upon the bed.</p>

<p>“Did I hit it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“I knew it.... It is an art requiring practice.”</p>

<p>Again and again he belabored the bed with his
weapon, asking after each blow if he had struck
the mark. “I fancy,” he said, “I am becoming more
accomplished. I—er—am pretending it is a human
head. I am endeavoring to visualize it as the head
of an individual obnoxious to me.”</p>

<p>“But why? What are you about?”</p>

<p>“I have heard it said that desperate situations
demand desperate remedies. I am about to become
desperate. Do I look desperate?” He turned to
her hopefully.</p>

<p>“I—you look very determined.”</p>

<p>“It is, perhaps, the same thing. I <i>am</i> very determined.
I am inexorable.... Please listen at the
door. If he comes upon us before I have time to
make essential preparations, my desperation will be
of no avail.”</p>

<p>Carmel went to the door and listened while Evan
continued to belabor the bed. “Decidedly,” he
panted, “I am becoming proficient. I hit it ten
times hand-running.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Please, listen.... You see how impossible it
is for me to escape. I am unable to walk, much
less to make satisfactory speed.... You, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
are intact. Also, if one of us is found to be absent,
this unspeakable plan must fail. I am working
upon a plan—a desperate plan—to make possible the
absence of one of us—namely, yourself.”</p>

<p>“Silly!... Do you think I would leave you here—for
them to—to do what they wanted to?”</p>

<p>“If you escape they will dare do nothing to me.
That is clear. Undoubtedly they will be chagrined,
and at least one of their number will be—in a position
to require medical attention. I trust this will
be so. I should like to feel I have injured somebody.
A latent savagery is coming to the surface
in me.”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I think I had best assume the position necessary
to my plan,” he said. “Would you mind helping
me to the door?”</p>

<p>He hitched his chair along until it stood close to
the wall at the side of the door opposite from its
hinges. Evan flattened himself against the wall
where it would be impossible for one entering the
door to see him until well within the room.</p>

<p>“There,” he said. “You, also, have your part.”</p>

<p>“What—what must I do?”</p>

<p>“He will be carrying a tray of dishes. If—events
should so shape themselves that he should drop this,
a tremendous and alarming crash would result. It
would spell disaster. You, therefore, will be at the
door when the man opens it, and will reach for the
tray. Be sure you have it grasped firmly—and on
no account—it matters not how startled you may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
at what follows—are you to drop it. Everything
depends upon that.”</p>

<p>“And then——”</p>

<p>“A great deal depends upon yourself. The unexpectedness
of our attempt will militate in our favor.
Should matters eventuate as I expect, you will be
able to leave this room. From that instant I cannot
help you.... But, an attempt on our part
not being expected, I rather imagine you will be
able to make your way downstairs and out of doors....
It is only a chance, of course. It may fail, in
which event we will be no worse off than we are
at present.... You will then hasten to Gibeon
and take such measures as you conceive to be
adequate.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t leave you.... I shan’t, I shan’t, I
shan’t.”</p>

<p>His lips compressed and an expression appeared
upon his face which she had never seen there before.
It was masterful, an expression of conscious
force. It was the real man peering through its disguise.
His hand clenched into a fist.</p>

<p>“By Heavens!” he said, “you’ll do as you’re told.”</p>

<p>“Evan!”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” he said. “Now make ready.”</p>

<p>They waited, wordless. It was five minutes perhaps
before heavy feet ascended the stairs, and they
heard the rattle of dishes as the man set down his
tray to unlock the door. He thrust it open with
his foot, picked up the tray and stepped through the
opening. Carmel stood before him. She stretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
out her hands for the tray and grasped it.... As
she did so, Evan Pell, standing poised over his
chair, swung forward his homely weapon.... His
practice had made for efficiency. The doorknob
thudded sickeningly upon the man’s bald head; he
stood swaying an instant, then his knees declined
further to sustain his weight, and he folded up into
a limp heap on the floor.</p>

<p>“Pull him inside and shut the door,” Evan
snapped. “I—er—find in myself a certain adaptability....
Put on your wrap and hat. Hurry....
The front way. Keep out of sight. Can you
drive a car?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If one is standing in front—steal it.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Now—go.”</p>

<p>“I—Oh, Evan.”</p>

<p>She was in his arms, and her lips to his. “I—If
they kill you I shall die, too.”</p>

<p>He opened the door and stared into the dimly
lighted hall. “It is clear. Go.”</p>

<p>“Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Go. You’re wasting time.” He pushed her
through the door. “Our best hope is that they—to
my surprise—have underestimated me....
Good-by.... I—er—seem to have underestimated
myself.... I seem to have been—exceptionally inefficient
in a field quite foreign to my previous activities. Hasten.”</p>

<p>He shut the door and Carmel stood alone, dependent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
upon herself, without other hope or reliance
than in her own expedients. She moved softly down
the hall, reached the top of the stairs which led
downward to another hall and the front door. She
listened. There was no alarming sound.... She
descended halfway and stopped again. The lower
hall, apparently, was in the middle of the house. To
the left was the room which had been the bar in the
days when liquor might be sold openly; at the right
was the dining room. The door to the dining room
was closed; that into the bar stood open—and there
was her danger. She must pass that door without
being seen. Once outside, the danger decreased almost
to a minimum. Could she reach the shelter of
the woods, she felt she would be safe.</p>

<p>She crept downward; reached the ground floor and
flattened herself against the wall. What if the front
door should open and somebody should enter?...
She hesitated, then peered cautiously through the
door and into the bar.... As she did so she heard
an automobile drive up in front and stop.... In
the bar she saw Peewee Bangs sitting, his feet on a
table, reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>Feet ascended the steps outside, and she cowered.
A hand rattled the knob, and she heard Bangs drop
his feet to the floor, with the scrape of his chair
as he turned.... The door opened. Something,
not conscious volition, moved Carmel. As the door
opened and a man stepped in, she sprang forward,
brushed past him, and ran down the steps. Behind
her she heard a shout—the squeaky voice of Peewee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
Bangs.... Before her stood a Ford, its engine
agitating the whole car, and she ran toward it and
threw herself into the seat. In an instant she had
grasped the wheel and adjusted her foot to the
clutch.... Then she was conscious of a jar, and
out of the corner of her eye saw Bangs’s face, distorted
with rage, saw his hand reaching for her arm....
She screamed. Then her hand, chance led, fell
upon the seat, encountered a heavy wrench.... She
lifted it, dashed it with all her strength into that
inhuman face.... It vanished.... The next
thing of which she became clearly conscious was of
speed, of a rocking, bounding car.... She was
free, had escaped her pursuer, and was rushing with
every ounce of power the little car possessed toward
Gibeon....</p>

<p>Was there a car to follow her? A larger, more
powerful, faster car?... She did not know. She
glanced behind. There was nothing yet, no pursuing
headlight. Carmel gripped the wheel and threw down
the gas lever to its final notch.... Around corners,
through puddles, over patches rutted by heavy
wheels, she forced the little car. It rocked, skidded,
threatened, but always righted itself and kept on its
way.... She looked behind again.... Headlights!...
By this time she must be half a mile or
more from the hotel. It would be a good car which
could make up that lead in the short distance to
Gibeon.... Yet, as she looked back from time to
time, the headlights drew closer and closer.... She
could see straggling lights now—the fringe of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
village.... Would they dare follow her into the
town itself? She fancied not.... The bridge lay
before her—and the pursuing car roared not a hundred
yards behind. She swept across the river and
sped down Main Street at a rate never witnessed
before by that drowsy thoroughfare.... She was
safe.... Before her was the Town Hall—lighted
brightly.... She looked back. The pursuing car
was not to be seen.</p>

<p>The town meeting! The citizens of Gibeon were
there upon the town’s business. She brought the car
to a stop before the door, leaped out, and ran up the
stairs. The hall was crowded. On the platform
stood the chairman of the town board.... Carmel
was conscious of no embarrassment, only of the need
for haste, of the necessity for finding help. She
entered the room and made her way up the aisle to
the platform. Without hesitating she mounted the
steps, unconscious of the craning of necks, the whisperings,
the curiosity her arrival was causing.</p>

<p>The chairman halted in his remarks. Carmel, in
her excitement, ignored him, almost shouldered him
aside.</p>

<p>“Men—men of Gibeon,” she said, “crime is being
committed, perhaps murder is being done, at this
minute.... What are you going to do?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE hall was still. It was as if, by some necromancy
of words, Carmel had turned to stone the
town meeting of Gibeon. She looked down into faces
which seemed to her white and strained. The faces
waited. She had caught them by her words; gripped
them. Something was about to happen. Every man
in the room felt the imminence of grave events. The
very air tingled with it as if waves of some vital
force agitated the air and discharged themselves with
such force as to be felt by physical touch.... It
was Carmel Lee’s first public appearance, yet she was
not frightened. Rather she was eager; words jostled
with one another for the privilege of being uttered
first. She paused, staring down into those faces.</p>

<p>“Men of Gibeon,” she said, and her little fist,
clenched with knuckles showing white, lifted from
her side and extended itself toward them, “Men of
Gibeon, I have found the body of Sheriff Churchill....
He was murdered!...”</p>

<p>The faces seemed to move in unison as if they
were painted upon a single canvas and the canvas had
been suddenly jerked by an unseen hand. They became
audible by an intake of the breath.</p>

<p>“I found him,” Carmel said, “close by the Lakeside
Hotel.... Since yesterday I have been a prisoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
in the Lakeside Hotel, I and Evan Pell.... I
went to find him. I found Sheriff Churchill; I saw
five great trucks unload in the hotel yard, and those
trucks were carrying whisky from the other side of
the border.... It was whisky, men of Gibeon,
which killed Sheriff Churchill. It was the men who
are trafficking in liquor who murdered him.... I
know their names. I have seen them and been their
prisoner.... At this moment Evan Pell, locked in
a room of that unspeakable place, is in danger of his
life. He is injured, cannot escape nor defend himself.
Yet he made it possible for me to escape and
to come to you for help....” Again she paused.</p>

<p>“I could not go to the law because the law does
not belong to the people of Gibeon. It has been
bought and paid for. It is owned by criminals and
by murderers.... We have a new sheriff....
That man’s hands are red with the blood of the man
whose place he fills.... So I have come to you,
for there is no other law in Gibeon to-night than
yourselves.”</p>

<p>There had been no movement, no sound, only
that tense, fateful silence.</p>

<p>“Will you permit this thing? Will you continue
to allow your town and your county to rest under
this dreadful thing? You can stop it to-night. You
can wipe it out forever.... Let me tell you what
I know.”</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly, eloquently. In that moment she
was no longer a young woman, but a leader, a
prophet, one sent to deliver a message, and she delivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
it fittingly. Her words descended upon those
upturned faces, compelling belief. There could be
no doubt.... She described the plot against herself
as Bangs had recited it tauntingly—how she was to
have been made a thing to scorn and to turn aside
from; how that part of her which was more valuable
to her than life itself was to have been murdered.
At the recital the faces moved again, became audible
again in a murmur which held kinship with a snarl....
Gibeon was awakening.</p>

<p>Point by point, fact by fact, she drove home to
them the conditions among which they had been living,
but one name she withheld until the moment
should come for its utterance.... She described
the activities of the whisky smugglers, the workings
of their organization, its power—the intelligence
which directed it.</p>

<p>“Will you endure this, men of Gibeon?... No
time may be lost. At this instant a man stands under
the shadow of death! What are you going to do?
Will you let him die?”</p>

<p>In the hall a man arose. “What is the name of this
man—the man who is to blame for all this?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“His name,” said Carmel, “is Abner Fownes!”</p>

<p>It was as if they had expected it; there was no
demonstration, no confusion. The men of Gibeon
were strangely unmoved, strangely silent, strangely
stern. It was as if they were moved by a common
impulse, a common determination. They were not
many individuals, but a single entity.... They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
been molded into solidity—and that solidity was
Gibeon.</p>

<p>The faces were faces no longer, but human beings,
men standing erect as if waiting for a signal....
Among them Carmel saw Jared Whitefield. His eyes
encountered hers, and he nodded....</p>

<p>“Will you come with me?” she cried. “Will
you follow me?... Those who will follow—come!...”</p>

<p>She descended from the platform and a lane opened
before her; she reached the door and turned....
The men of Gibeon were behind her, and as if they
were a company marching behind its commander
they followed her down the stairs. There was no
shouting, no confusion, no unsightly mob spirit....
Along the street stood waiting cars, the cars of the
farmers of the town, and men crowded into them
beyond their capacity.... It was a crusade, the
crusade of Gibeon, and Carmel had preached it.</p>

<p>They started quietly, grimly, an orderly procession.
It moved through the streets, across the bridge, and
out the road toward the Lakeside Hotel.... A
hundred men bent upon purging their community of a
thing which had debauched it.... On and on, urgent,
inexorable, moved the line of cars.... Then
a sudden stop. The road was barricaded, and men
with rifles stood behind to block the way.</p>

<p>“What’s this here?” bellowed a voice out of the
darkness. “What kind of goin’s on is this here?”
It was Sheriff Jenney.</p>

<p>There was no answer. “I order ye to disperse and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
git to your homes quietly,” he said. “We hain’t
goin’ to have no mobbin’ in Gibeon.”</p>

<p>The cars emptied and men crowded forward.
“Out of the way, Jenney,” a voice commanded.
“We’re in no humor to be meddled with to-night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go resistin’ an officer,” Jenney roared.
“Disperse like I told ye.”</p>

<p>Then Jared Whitefield forced his way to the front,
and on either side of him were strangers to Gibeon.
They leaped the barricade before Jenney, taken by
surprise, could move his hand. Whitefield dropped
a heavy hand on Jenney’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Jenney,” he said, “drop that gun. You’re under
arrest.”</p>

<p>“Arrest!... Me? Who kin arrest the sheriff
of a county.” He laughed loudly.</p>

<p>“I can,” said Whitefield. “Drop that gun.”</p>

<p>Jenney twisted in Whitefield’s grip, but the huge
man held him as in a vise.</p>

<p>“You’ve gone ag’in’ somethin’ bigger than a township
or a county, Jenney, or even a state.... It’s
the United States of America that’s puttin’ you under
arrest, Jenney, through me, its duly appointed marshal....
<i>Drop that gun!</i>”</p>

<p>The United States of America! The Federal authorities
had taken a hand. That explained Whitefield’s
absence.... The United States!... Carmel
sobbed. In this thing she had the might of
America behind her! The authority of a nation!</p>

<p>“Put him in a car,” Whitefield directed his companions;
and it was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Whitefield,” called a voice, “you hain’t goin’ to
interfere? You hain’t goin’ to stop us?”</p>

<p>“I got nothin’ to do with you,” Whitefield said.
“I got what I come for.”</p>

<p>The cars filled again, the obstruction was removed,
and once again the men of Gibeon moved toward
their objective. They reached it, surrounded it,
men burst in its doors and laid hands upon whomever
they found.... Carmel, well escorted, ran up
the stairs.</p>

<p>“That’s the door,” she cried, and powerful shoulders
thrust it from its hinges.</p>

<p>“Evan!...” she cried. “Evan!...”</p>

<p>He lay upon the floor, motionless. Carmel knelt
beside him, frantic at the sight of his motionlessness.
She lifted his head to her lap, peered into his white
face, stared at his closed eyes.</p>

<p>“They’ve killed him,” she said, in a dull, dead
voice. “We’ve come too late.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hopper, of the Gibeon bank, thrust his
hand inside Evan’s shirt to feel for the beating of
his heart.... It was distinguishable, faint but
distinguishable.</p>

<p>“He’s not dead,” said Hopper, “but somebody’s
beat hell out of him.”</p>

<p>They lifted him gently and carried him down the
stairs. Carmel walked by his side, silent, stunned....
He was not dead, but he was horribly injured.
He would die.... She knew she would never
again see his eyes looking into hers. They placed
him in a car, and she sat, supporting his weight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
her arm about him, his head heavy upon her
breast....</p>

<p>“Everybody out?” roared a voice.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s out!”</p>

<p>Carmel saw a light appear inside the hotel, a light
cast by no lamp or lantern.... It increased, leaped,
flamed. Room after room was touched by the illumination.
It climbed the stairs, roared outward
through windows, spreading, crackling, hissing, devouring....
In a dozen minutes the Lakeside Hotel
was wrapped in flame—a beacon light in Gibeon’s
history. High and higher mounted the flames until
the countryside for miles about was lighted by it,
notified by it that a thing was happening, that Gibeon
was being purified by fire.</p>

<p>“Is there no doctor here?” Carmel cried.</p>

<p>“Doc Stewart’s some’eres.... I’ll git him.”</p>

<p>The doctor was found and came. He examined
Evan as best he could. “Better get him to town.
Can’t tell much now.... Depends on whether
there’s concussion.... I’ll go along with you.”</p>

<p>“Before you go, Miss Lee—where—is the sheriff?
Sheriff Churchill?”</p>

<p>“Follow the shore—that way. You’ll find him—on
the edge.”</p>

<p>“We got Peewee Bangs—he was hidin’ in a boat-house.”</p>

<p>“I—I’m glad,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>The car moved away, bearing Carmel, Evan, and
the doctor. Somehow it seemed like the end of the
world to her—a definite stopping place of things.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
The lurid flames making a ghastly forest, black figures
flitting about from shadow to shadow, the confusion
of her thoughts, the piling up for days of
event upon event and emotion upon emotion—all
this seemed to be a climax—a finality. There was
an unreality about it all, an unnatural crowding of
events, a hustling and jostling, as if she were in an
overwrought throng of occurrences, adventures,
events, crises which pushed and shoved and harried
her, striving ever to thrust her out of their way that
they might march unimpeded. There rested upon
her now a curious listlessness, a lifelessness, as if
they had succeeded, as if they had elbowed her off
the road of life, upon which she could never regain
a footing.</p>

<p>Gibeon was aroused; Gibeon was crusading! The
thought awakened no thrill. She was safe; never
again would she be threatened by the forces which
she had challenged. She was free to pursue her
way—but the knowledge came as dead knowledge.
She did not care. She cared for nothing—because
she knew, she was positive, Evan Pell had gone from
her forever....</p>

<p>The car stopped before the doctor’s house and
Evan was carried up to a bedroom, unconscious still....
Doctor Stewart tried to exclude her from the
room, but she would not be excluded. This was all
she had left; all life held for her—that faint, irregular
beating of Evan Pell’s heart.... She knew
those heartbeats were her own, would be her own so
long as they persisted.... She would remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
would sit by him watching, watching, waiting. This
scarcely perceptible life was all she would ever have
of him, and she dared lose no instant of it.</p>

<p>Doctor Stewart worked over the bed. Carmel
thought him calm, terribly indifferent, businesslike.
He was a tradesman working at a trade when she
would have had him a god performing a miracle....
After a time he turned to her.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell,” he said. “Some concussion is
present. There seems to be no fracture of the skull....
What internal injuries he may have suffered—it
is impossible to say.... In the morning....”</p>

<p>“He will be dead,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. “I do not think so.
I hope—in such cases one cannot be sure—but——”</p>

<p>“He will be dead,” said Carmel.</p>

<p>“It is in God’s hand,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“They have killed him—because he was brave, because
he loved me—because—— Oh, Doctor, that is
the awful thought—he is dead for me. He gave his
life for me.”</p>

<p>His hand rested upon her shoulder with the gentle
touch which some men learn by a life of service—and
Doctor Stewart, country physician, unrecognized,
unsung, had lived such a life. “My dear,”
he said, “how better could a man die?”</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> killed him—Abner Fownes killed him.”</p>

<p>“Abner Fownes has run his course,” said the
doctor.</p>

<p>“It is not enough—not enough. The law can do
nothing to him which will make him pay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“The punishment of the law,” said the doctor, “is
a puny thing beside the punishment of God.”</p>

<p>Carmel stood up; she bent over the bed and kissed
Evan upon the cold lips.... Something possessed
her, controlled her, a power stronger than herself,
an impulse more urgent than she had ever known.
It moved her as if she were an automaton, a puppet
ordered and regulated by strings in the hands of its
fabricator. She moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked the doctor.</p>

<p>“I have a thing to do,” she said.</p>

<p>He peered into her face and saw there that which
shocked him, startled him. He would have stayed
her. “Wait——” he commanded. She eluded his
outstretched hand and hurried down the stairs. There
was no indecision in her step or in her manner. There
was no indecision in her soul. She knew where she
was going, and why she was going.... She was on
her way to find Abner Fownes!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABNER FOWNES was sitting in his library waiting
for word from Sheriff Jenney. If matters
went to-night as he felt certain they must go, he
could live again in security, untroubled by conscience,
with no apprehensions, and with his financial worries
removed. Five truckloads of liquor had been discharged
at the Lakeside Hotel. He knew that. The
importation had been successful, without a hitch.
Within a week the whisky would be distributed and
the cash in hand.... It would be sufficient to clear
his most troublesome obligations and to put him on
his feet again. He considered this with a glow of
satisfaction....</p>

<p>Carmel Lee had constituted a threat, but she was
powerless to threaten now. At any moment word
would arrive that she was in Jenney’s hands, her
reputation in Gibeon would be destroyed, and she
would be powerless. Public opinion would drive
her from the place.</p>

<p>Abner sat back comfortably in his chair and looked
forward to a life of quiet and importance. He would
continue to live in security as Gibeon’s first citizen.
He might even seek political preferment. In a year
there would be a senatorial election. Why should he
not stand for the position. To be Senator from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
state—that was something, indeed. And why not?
His reflections carried him to Washington. He saw
himself in the Senate Chamber, listened to his voice
rolling forth sonorous periods, heard with infinite
satisfaction the applause of his fellow Senators....</p>

<p>The telephone rang and he was guilty of unseemly
haste to reach the instrument.</p>

<p>“Hello!... Hello!... Who is it? Is it
Jenney?”</p>

<p>“No,” said a voice, “it’s Deputy Jackson....
Look out for yourself.... There’s hell——”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“The whole town meetin’s rushin’ off to Peewee’s
place. Reg’lar mob.... Jenney he set out to stop
’em, but he’s arrested.”</p>

<p>“Jenney arrested!”</p>

<p>“Federal authorities. Him and two others is
pinched. Better look out for yourself. I’m goin’ to.”</p>

<p>The receiver banged on its hook at the other end
of the line. He was alone. Washington vanished,
glowing dreams of the future gave place to the grim
reality of the present. The Federal authorities!...
He had considered them negligible. Somehow one
lost sight of the Federal government in that remote
region; they were unfamiliar; it seemed a spot to
which their writ did not run.</p>

<p>He tried to consider the fact coolly and calmly, but
his brain refused to function in such a manner. He
was confused; the suddenness, the unexpectedness of
the blow from such a source shook him from his
foundations. What did it mean? How had it come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
about.... Clearly, if Jenney was under arrest, he
could not complete his raid on the Lakeside Hotel
and so abolish Carmel Lee.... That was that....
But how did it affect him? How did it affect the
thousands of dollars’ worth of liquor so necessary to
his financial rehabilitation?...</p>

<p>The big question—was he threatened personally?—was
one he could not answer. There had been no
sign of threat. Jenney was arrested. Perhaps they
did not mean to arrest him, had no evidence against
him.... But could Jenney be depended upon to
keep his mouth shut?... Jenney, he confessed to
himself, did not seem a man capable of great loyalty,
nor possessed of high courage. He would weaken.
Under pressure he would tell all he knew.... The
advice of the voice over the telephone was good. He
would look out for himself....</p>

<p>He rushed up the stairs to make ready for flight.
It would be a good idea to absent himself, no matter
what happened. If worst came to worst—why, he
would be out of reach of the law. If matters turned
out otherwise it would be easy to return from a
hurried business trip.... He began packing frantically.
Having packed, he went to the safe in his
library and transferred sufficient funds to his pocketbook.
Then, as a precautionary measure, he carefully
destroyed certain private papers.... This
consumed time.</p>

<p>The telephone rang again, and Abner answered in
no little trepidation.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fownes?” asked a voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“Yes. Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Tucker.... Say, the mob’s burned Lakeside
Hotel. They’ve got Peewee.... Burned her up
slick and clean—and everythin’ in it. The whole
shipment’s gone....”</p>

<p>Fownes dropped the receiver and sank nerveless
into a chair. At any rate, he was ruined. That much
was certain. Nothing remained to fight for now but
his personal security, his liberty. He snatched up
his bag and moved toward the door.... His plan
was not clear—only the first step of it. He would
rent an automobile and drive out of town with what
speed was possible.... As he reached the door he
realized with a sudden sharp pang that he was leaving
his house for good, leaving Gibeon forever.
He, Abner Fownes, first citizen, man of substance,
was fleeing from his native place like the commonest
criminal.</p>

<p>Dazedly he wondered how it had come about ...
somehow, he felt, that girl was at the bottom of the
thing. His misfortunes were due to her meddling.
He wished he could get his fingers upon her throat.</p>

<p>He descended the steps and walked toward the
street. The night was dark, dark enough to conceal
his movements, perhaps to avert recognition....
A certain confidence came to him. He would get
away; he would possess liberty and his intelligence
which had served him so well.... There were other
places—and he was not old. Perhaps....</p>

<p>As he turned out upon the street a figure confronted
him. He halted, drew back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>“Abner Fownes,” said a voice, “where are you
going?”</p>

<p>“You!... You!...” he said, hoarsely. His
fingers twitched, fury burned in his heart, and the
desire to slay. He looked about him. All was blackness....
Here she was, this girl who was sending
him crashing down in ruin....</p>

<p>“He is dead,” said Carmel. “You are a murderer
again. Abner Fownes.... You’re running away.”</p>

<p>“Out of my way, you—you——”</p>

<p>“You’ve killed him,” she said. “You must be
punished for that.... You must not go away. You
must wait until they come.”</p>

<p>“You—you’ve done this—you——” He was
working himself into a rage. He was not the man
to do a violence in cold blood.</p>

<p>“I have done it.... But to what good? He is
dead—is dying.... Nothing can pay for that. He
will go away from me forever.... Abner Fownes,
you are a murderer, and you must pay for it....
Oh, if I could make you pay a thousand, thousand
times.... And you shall pay!”</p>

<p>He dropped his bag and reached for her throat
with clutching fingers. She stepped back, avoiding
him.</p>

<p>“They are coming now,” she said. “See....
There are their lights.... Wait, Abner Fownes.
You cannot get away. If you try to go I shall hold
you.”</p>

<p>He turned. Up the road approached a multitude
of automobile lights. Gibeon was returning from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
its crusade!... He uttered a shrill, unnatural cry
and made as if to rush past her, but Carmel grasped
his arm. “Wait,” she said.</p>

<p>He waited. A feeling of powerlessness swept over
him. A sense of impotence and defeat and despair....
He could not force himself to raise his hand
against this girl. He was afraid. He was afraid
of <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>She remained standing in the middle of the walk,
blocking his way, but it was unnecessary to block his
way. He could not have moved.... A cold, clinging
dread was upon him. He was afraid of the
night, of the darkness. He dared not be alone with
the night.... If Carmel had gone Abner Fownes
would have followed her, would have called her back,
begged her to stay with him....</p>

<p>The lights of the first car rested upon them, illuminating
the spot.... Carmel stepped forward and
signaled. The car stopped, halting the procession....
Men got down and surrounded him....</p>

<p>“Where,” said Carmel, “is Sheriff Churchill?”</p>

<p>“There,” said a man.</p>

<p>“Carry him here,” she ordered, and it was done.</p>

<p>Wrapped in blankets, the thing that had been Sheriff
Churchill was laid on the sidewalk at Abner
Fownes’s feet.</p>

<p>“Uncover his face. Let this man look at him,”
Carmel said. “Make him look.... Make him
look....”</p>

<p>Fownes covered his face, staggered back. “No....
No.... Take—take it away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“Uncover his face,” said Carmel. “Take this man’s
hands from his eyes.... Make him look....”</p>

<p>They obeyed. Fownes stood quivering, eyes
tightly shut.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Carmel. “<i>Look!</i>”</p>

<p>She overmastered him. He opened his eyes and
looked at the dreadful sight. He stared, bent forward.
His hands stretched out, clawlike, as he stared
at the horror. Then he threw back his head and
laughed, and the laughter ended in a shriek....
He swayed, half turned, and fell back into the arms
of the men of Gibeon....</p>

<p>Jared Whitefield forced his way to Fownes’s side.
“I will take charge of him,” he said. “Will some
one take care of this girl.... She hain’t herself....
Take her back to Doc Stewart’s....”</p>

<p>Morning penetrated the room where Carmel sat,
entering gently, gently pushing back the night. Carmel
sat wide-eyed, waiting, waiting. She had not
slept, had not closed her eyes. From time to time she
had climbed the stairs to look upon Evan Pell’s face,
to be told that he lived, that his condition was unchanged....
She was worn, weary. Nothing mattered
now. She was at the end of things, wishing
for death.</p>

<p>Doctor Stewart came to the door.</p>

<p>“Can you step upstairs, Miss Lee?”</p>

<p>“Is—is he——”</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>Carmel followed. Doubtless he was sinking, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
she was summoned to be present at the end....
She entered the room. Her heart was cold, heavy,
dead. As she approached the beside she could not lift
her eyes to Evan’s face.</p>

<p>“Carmel—dear....” said a voice.</p>

<p>Her heart came to life; it warmed, leaped in her
bosom. She dared to look. His eyes were open,
conscious, intelligent.</p>

<p>“Evan!... Evan!...” she cried and sank on
her knees beside him. Her eyes devoured his face,
and he smiled.</p>

<p>“Doctor—Doctor,” she cried, “is he—will
he——”</p>

<p>“I think,” said the doctor, “we can have him on
his feet in a week, slightly damaged, of course.”</p>

<p>“And I thought—I thought you would die,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Die!” Evan Pell’s voice, weak and faint, nevertheless
carried a note of surprise. “Er—of course
not. I had not the slightest intention—of dying.”
He fumbled for her hand. “Why my dear—I have—just
come to—life.”</p>

<p>“You would have given your life for me!...
Oh, Evan, I love you! ... and I’m so—so proud
of you.”</p>

<p>“Er—very gratifying,” said Evan. Then, for a
moment he was silent, reflecting.</p>

<p>“It is—very satisfying to—be in love,” he said.
“I—like it.” Then. “I want you to—be proud—of
me.” He smiled. “There’s just—one thing—I am
proud of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“What is that, sweetheart?”</p>

<p>“The—er—way I—handled that doorknob—with
so little practice,” he said. “It was—er—so foreign
to my training.... It—showed adaptability....”</p>
